qi088l submission Bitcoin hashrate returns to May levels and points to a new all-time high 
hiia7vo comment It's kind of amazing that we have a system where \~50% of the energy used to sustain it can go offline in an instant and have virtually no effect. An end user would only have noticed slower blocks rolling in, and only until the difficulty adjustment kicked in.

I really feel like this resiliency is downplayed when we talk about Bitcoin's strengths. Can you imagine the pandemonium if 50% of our banking system's servers went offline? 
higc01a comment tldr; The hashrate of Bitcoin (BTC) mining this week reached the capacity assumed five months ago, before the Chinese onslaught against BTC and the rest of the cryptocurrencies. According to BitInfoCharts estimates, the Bitcoin network’s hash rate stood at 172,713 exahashes (EH/s) earlier this week, the same figure recorded in mid-May. The rise in the rate coincides with the new historical maximum of the price of BTC registered in recent days.

higg4bm comment Take my upvote! 
hihep7n comment Hash rate doesn't dictate price.

Edit: What is controversial about what i said? 
hig9b32 comment So that means the electricity consumption will surpass the consumption of the entire financial sector (including all bank servers, offices and ATMs) by the end of the year? Seems legit! 
higxpuh comment OLB has 1/3 operating capacity as SDIG and trades at 1/15 the market cap (37m bs 550m) and SDIG is down 30% off it’s ATH when btc was at 67. OLB has 24,000 miners on order and will never be the biggest or in the middle but based on the rest of the market it is undervalued by a factor of 10+. OLB is about to join the bitcoin miner party. This has 2-4 weeks from going esoteric to exoteric and becoming just another leveraged long play on the BTC chart in public markets.   - x 
hihkb8w comment No, but it relates to the 4 year cycle price movement.  Therefore, new highs and the end of the bull run can be expected in the coming months. 
hij7oj5 comment Exactly! Price dictates hash rate. 
hii3gab comment Though it's related. Miners work to make profits. If not making money, miners go offline and hash rate drops.

higf7oy comment Good article on Investopedia that should answer your questions, mostly - https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-happens-bitcoin-after-21-million-mined/ 
higkefj comment Bitcoin's decentralization is in its node network. Why are there no concern trolls about the tiny size of the node network?  

Yes, some miners will quit. Bitcoin doesn't care 
higassj comment There will probably be some billion dollar invention that mines the last of it over night. 
higas3g comment I dont think massive farms would care

if game theory is right, then by the time the last block is mined, most of the world will use btc to value things

"if all of the coins were mined already" sounds like a different coin

higf40t comment The bitcoin (dot) com domain is owned by a convicted felon who describes himself as "Bitcoin Jesus" and has a long history of unscrupulous behavior. From [vouching for MtGox solvency before it collapsed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/77vrek/roger_ver_on_mtgox_bitcoin_exchange_for_the/), to promoting Craig Wright [as if he were Satoshi Nakamoto](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/776fim/funny_how_all_the_criminals_and_fraudsters_in/), the owner acquired the "r / btc" subreddit and packed its mod team with paid employees to spread divisive misinformation about the bitcoin protocol and various individuals in the bitcoin space, including this subreddit as a whole. He has also leveraged the domain and subreddit to promote an impostor altcoin to unsuspecting newcomers as if it were actually Bitcoin. As such, the domain is considered malicious, and the r/Bitcoin mod team kindly asks that readers seek out credible sources to post instead.

higk4i2 comment It actually is, but we’re assuming less extreme inflation than what a lot of the pundits are sensationalizing. The US govt isn’t just going to let the world’s reserve currency (while its reserve status lasts) go to being totally worthless in 5 years, it’ll take longer than that. 

Look at the devaluation of the British Pound throughout the entirety of the 20th century and you’ll get an idea of how the US Dollar will devalue throughout the 21st century.

The sun fired off an X1-class solar flare, its most powerful kind of flare, that peaked at 11:35 a.m. EDT (1535 GMT), according to an alert from the US Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC). The flare caused a temporary radio blackout across the sunlit side of Earth.

higkt10 comment Fortune favors the prepared mind.  

There's Bitcoin, and then there's "crypto" -- alt-coins.

Nearly every alt-coin is a shitcoin. Maybe a handful out of many thousands are not pure scam shitcoins. All the others are pure scam shitcoins. Most people lack the skills and knowledge to be able to discern the few non-scam coins from the long list of all alt-coins.

Shitcoins are sold to numbskulls who think they're so fucking smart that they're going to discover and buy "the next Bitcoin" early and get rich quick.

Shitcoins are created by scammers to fleece the aforementioned group.

Only buy Bitcoin.  Don't get scammed.

higwqjo comment Hodlers all over the world would become super fit from all the jumping for joy that they are doing as the price 10x's then 100x's and keeps going. The USA control the world's reserve currency, if they start buying BTC then it is essentially a show of no confidence in their own currency. The whole world will immediately shit their pants (most countries have a reserve that contains a lot of USD) and start doing the same, the USD would collapse and take out all other currencies with it. BTC would become the global reserve currency.

hih6oio comment It is a pretty surreal thing that if shit hits the fan, if worst comes to worst... we could liquidate large quantities of money that others in our generation likely couldn't do with minimal effort on our parts over a relatively short period of time. 
hih70jd comment I think I have a problem, as soon as I get paid I pretty much put it all into bitcoin, yet still I’m net positive, it’s ridiculous. 
hihnep7 comment I too bought bitcoin in April for the first time, at 49K or something. Then I made a lot of mistakes, the most stupid one being not buying that major dip at 29K (I thought it’d go further down and had a buy order waiting at 22K). 
But the most important thing that happened is that I started MSc in digital currency and blockchain, I’m literally a student of Bitcoin. Now I’m buying at 62K, hoping for the dips, and I’m more scared of keeping fiat than buying more at 60K.
I’m also preparing and saving up for the bear market.

higrbn6 comment how much bitcoin did you have mate? 
the problem can be split into two 1) recovering the files 2) figuring out how to access them. 
higtsgd comment All you need is the seed phrase. Why did you restore the hard drive? 
hiha44g comment Try to restore 12 words in electrum.org wallet. 
higrq6u comment Several hundred dollars at the time (which was before the large increases in value over the past five years, so probably thousands of dollars worth).

As I said, I have access to the old hard drive and have already copied over any files I think might be relevant (and if I'm missing any, they're still on the old hard drive so I can always grab them).  So "recovering the files" isn't the issue - the issue is restoring an old MultiBit HD wallet on a new computer, and then transferring to a program no longer defunct (i.e., not MultiBit HD).

higyhex comment No point in paying it off now with zero interest and deferred payments. 
hih0ixm comment Nobody here can tell the future. No matter how bullish we are or how bullish the charts look, if bitcoin dropped 50% in the next 2 months, would you still be able to pay your bills? If that answer is no, you shouldn't hodl. If the answer is yes then the decision is yours to make and yours only imo. 
hih1bqz comment Hold.  Your loans aren't worth anything.  Pay it off slowly.  Inflation will decrease the actual value of that loan for you while you purchase things that are increasing in value.  The Fed isn't changing their monetary policy, and have made this crystal clear.  There's practically no risk.

hihbbhp comment You gotta decide what you're willing accept.  I'd be shocked if your bitcoin is worth less in late December than it is now, but it's possible.   So is the slim possibility that you could get hit with the interest a risk you're comfortable with?  Or will it be devastating to let that happen.  If you want to avoid the extra interest at all costs,  pay it now.   If it's just something you'd like to do then hodl. 
hiikroc comment Interest schminterest.   Just HODL, my friend. 
higzeph comment hodl (not financial advice) 
hih7kvz comment A little tip for you. You can negociate how much you're willing to pay on each dollar of the student loan if its in default for more than 7 years and if you can pay it off in 1 transaction.

This is what I plan to do come next year. I will negocate 50 cents on each dollar.

Hope this helps you out =) 
qi3tco submission Lightshot "leak" and scammers using it to steal BTC 
hii686s comment I discovered this a few months ago also, pretty sneaky operation,  just dropping fake screenshots of BTC creds,  invested some sites and they were all outdated. 

Im torn whether this is unethical though haha, 

1) You deserve to be scammed if you are thinking you are taking someone elses BTC and trying to get away with it. They are basically tricking the people that are happy to waltz in and steal someone elses Crypto, so serves them right to get scammed out of an initial withdrawal fee

2) Scammers in their essence are unethical/bad actors and what they are trying to do accomplish is unethical by tricking others to send them BTC

Can't tell what is right in this situation 
hih04hd comment anyone who logs into someone else's account and tries to transfer their money, even if fake, deserves to lose.

this isn't so much a scam. more like a filter for weeding out scumbags.

good 
hiijj4r comment More than a year ago, I wrote a crawler for this site, which I never finished. The random codes are base36 numbers.

After I finished the crawler and fought for a while with bot detection and proxies, I tried to scan screenshots for bank accounts and passwords. I wasn't into cryptos back then, but if would have been, I 100% would have fallen for this scam.

Lucky me, I guess 
hihoes9 comment The setup is irrelevant. If ANYTHING AT ALL asks for up front fee to enable withdrawals it's a scam. 
hii7veq comment Keep in mind though that I would probably try to transfer those coins just to keep them safe until the original owner got a new wallet and I could return them.  If it said there was a $10 withdrawal fee or something like that then I'd pay it to protect the original owner.

Although... I wouldn't be dumb enough to pay it from my own money.  If it said that I had to send some of my own coin instead of taking it from the BTC I was moving then I'd get suspicious and nope out of there.

Otherwise I fully support the idea of thieves stealing from thieves.  It's a pretty brilliant scam. 
hiijr4q comment If you upload your creds online, you also deserve to be scammed IMO. It's like dropping your wallet on the street and just leaving it. 
hiic44f comment It is quite brilliant,  I checked one of the websites and the fee was 0.001 or 0.002 BTC which is still nothing to sneeze at

qi4jj7 submission El Salvador vs Cyrpus 
hihqnko comment Nice to see that our little island-state (yes, I'm a Cyprus resident) is being put on the map of the crypto-world. I have been thinking about the exact same Master's Degree from the UoN myself and my main issue is that it's full time and on-campus ( I have a full time job). 

Cyprus has always been on the forefront of financial / auditing / accounting services with very high educational level of the Cypriots (mostly educated in Universities in the UK) and with equally high professional & educational level of expats, who make Cyprus their home. I have the belief that the island will soon join the developments in the crypto-world. I should add the very good quality of living, the fact that we are a member of the EU (with whatever that meant for our... notorious "passport program"). 

In other words, I would certainly recommend someone to come here for studies and connections to the world of financial services.

hihu49k comment Until we invent different approaches or technic like quantum computers. 
hii41wi comment The Jedi. The force. It’s true. All of it. 
hii5jly comment Jup this seems an alternative version of Bruce Schneier (Applied Cryptography (pp. 157–8))

>One of the consequences of the second law of thermodynamics is that a certain amount of energy is necessary to represent information. To record a single bit by changing the state of a system requires an amount of energy no less than kT, where T is the absolute temperature of the system and k is the Boltzman constant. (Stick with me; the physics lesson is almost over.)  
>  
>Given that k = 1.38×10-16 erg/°Kelvin, and that the ambient temperature of the universe is 3.2°Kelvin, an ideal computer running at 3.2°K would consume 4.4×10-16 ergs every time it set or cleared a bit. To run a computer any colder than the cosmic background radiation would require extra energy to run a heat pump.  
>  
>Now, the annual energy output of our sun is about 1.21×1041 ergs. This is enough to power about 2.7×1056 single bit changes on our ideal computer; enough state changes to put a 187-bit counter through all its values. If we built a Dyson sphere around the sun and captured all its energy for 32 years, without any loss, we could power a computer to count up to 2192. Of course, it wouldn’t have the energy left over to perform any useful calculations with this counter.  
>  
>But that’s just one star, and a measly one at that. A typical supernova releases something like 1051 ergs. (About a hundred times as much energy would be released in the form of neutrinos, but let them go for now.) If all of this energy could be channeled into a single orgy of computation, a 219-bit counter could be cycled through all of its states.  
>  
>These numbers have nothing to do with the technology of the devices; they are the maximums that thermodynamics will allow. And they strongly imply that brute-force attacks against 256-bit keys will be infeasible until computers are built from something other than matter and occupy something other than space.

(kidding.  buy it all). 
hiko0sg comment wow, that's great to add a great amount of investment in Bitcoin . Good luck. 
hiie7ql comment You know, I've been wondering... At this point If Michael Saylor had another billion dollars for microstrategy to purchase bitcoin then would it be more profitable for them to buy directly on an exchange for market price rather than OTC? For example, if he buys OTC then he'd hardly move the price and add a few thousand coins. However, if he bought directly on the exchange for market price he'd end up with less accumulated bitcoin, but he'd increase the spot price of bitcoin by so much that his current holdings of 100,000+ bitcoin would be worth so much more.

qi4sjs submission Stopping 401k investment for 4 years to buy more BTC. Smart or stupid? 
hih5y12 comment Are you saying Verizon matches 100% of your contribution (up to 6% of your pay)? If so I'd keep putting in 6% rather than 8%. It's doubling your contribution just by participating. 
hih66ia comment An employer 401k match is free guaranteed money. Don’t give that up. Also since the stock market is doing well you can get a good return on mutual funds that are in there. Is there a more aggressive growth fund in your 401k? 
hii3khv comment Let me give you a piece of advice. Compound interest might be the only way you retire comfortably. At MINIMUM, deposit enough to the the free employer match. Ideally, max out both 401k AND IRA accounts yearly. This is about $26,000 a year that can grow tax free. Buy GBTC for now, and soon enough you can buy spot ETF. I know you don't own the keys but get a grip, it's tax free money and taxes are very expensive. 
hii9als comment Another vote for 6%.
I would take the 2% and put it towards a Roth but it would be a self directed Roth ira. You would need to set aside money on the front end for all of the setup etc. 

The theory is you would have crypto in your self directed Roth ira that would have tax free gains later on. 
hih4qp0 comment Make sure you get your full employer match at least! Only guaranteed way to double your money 
hih7dqg comment 401k for sure. Within the next couple of years there will be a Bitcoin spot ETF. You probably won't have access to that in your 401k, but you will when you roll that into an IRA. Then you get the benefits of holding Bitcoin but in a tax-advantaged account. No fake boating accident required.

But for the sake of diversification you should probably also buy *some* Bitcoin in your own wallet. Even if you can't max out the 401k. There are tax avoidance strategies that can reduce your taxes across your whole portfolio if you have diverse kinds of accounts. 
hihzc1y comment I would take full advantage of the employer match and then use the rest for bitcoin.  Also buuy gbtc in your 401k 
hii5akk comment Go down to 6% for the 6% match 
Ever let free money get away and use the other 2% for crypto 
hii708n comment Don't give away free money.   Maybe drop it down to 6% but never go lower than that.   If you really want to use 401K money to buy BTC you could probably take a 401K loan if they offer it, then you're just paying yourself interest.  Not a recommendation just an option that's better than passing up free money. 
hiiivgc comment Take the 401k match & invest it into GBTC. You have tax sheltered exposure to btc and you’re not flushing that free money down the toilet. It is good to have at least slightly diversified holdings.

hih92oz comment It is Bitcoin that companies are buying and holding, it is Bitcoin that the greater financial world is taking seriously and acting to accommodate, and it is Bitcoin that the banking industry is afraid of and trying to deal with. It is Bitcoin that nations are starting to adopt as legal tender. It is Bitcoin that the general public is using as an actual store of value.

In the real world, no one is taking the plethora of shitcoins seriously. They're recognized for what they are--short-term pump and dump schemes--and are ignored for all other purposes. Oh they'd like to ride Bitcoin's wave, but the problem for them is, there's only one Bitcoin, and none of them are it.

My amount is not big at the moment, ever month i buy some extra.
But, now it is not much in euro, but in 10 years it is, so if it gets stolen now, in 10 years i lose a lot.

It's snagged up in the identity verification(I've submitted all documentation required, still waiting on them to let me send it off the exchange).  Getting run around/stonewalled by their support staff. 

Get it OUT of the exchange and onto a private digital wallet, ASAP.  Don't leave it there, ever.  In any amount.  Too risky.  

In any case, DO NOT USE [Blockchain.com](https://Blockchain.com), those guys are horribly mismanaged at best, and downright thieves at worst.

hii6g4j comment I say use the 1/3 method.. example.

You have $10,000 to invest.

Buy 1/3.... $3333.33 of BTC now. at spot price.

DCA in $278 a week for the next 3 months for a total of $3333.33 

Keep the last 1/3 as dry powder ready to buy the dips.

Good luck! 
hihqel8 comment Essentially you are asking if the price will be higher or lower at a certain date. The answer is: no one knows. The aggregated opinion of redditors doesn't have any meaning either. So you won't get any smarter from asking such questions. The answer to them depends on your personal financial circumstances and understanding of bitcoin, rather than on the current price anyway.    

In general, as they say: "time in the market beats timing the market". If you are buying for long term holding, the timing doesn't matter that much (because future prices are unpredictable, especially short term).  

This is assuming you are ok with losing all your money in the first place AND understand how to store it properly. Don't put more than that into bitcoin (or any other volatile asset), especially if you don't understand the basics of storage, wallet backups, transactions etc.

hihosla comment Shitcoins are scams. And off topic. 
qi5nug submission Imagine borrowing 1 BTC today and paying back the 1 BTC over 10 years...you'd owe way more. Will bitcoin cancel/reshape loans? 
hihiip9 comment Yes, bitcoin might actually cancel loans. Like you said, by borrowing bitcoin now you will owe a lot more later.

With fiat your money becomes worth less over time and it's impossible to save up faster than the price increases in housing we have seen over the last decade. So people have to take on increasingly bigger loans to get the capital to be able to purchase a house. Lenders are willing to lend out fiat for the loan so they get to counteract inflation. Thanks to inflation your loan becomes easier to pay off every year, so it all works out.

Bitcoin actually flips the system around. When you start working as a young adult your bitcoin is not worth "much", but keep saving up over the years and your bitcoin start to become worth more. With a deflationary system, saving actually gets rewarded instead of spending. Eventually you net worth will be enough to purchase a house, rewarding the work you put in early on in your younger years.

So we go from a system of instant gratification, having to take a huge loan to pay for housing right now and then having to pay it off for the rest of your life (like an extended credit card debt from hell), to delayed gratification, having to save now to be able to purchase a house later on (without going into debt). 
hiha93b comment Inflation.  Borrow in the inflating asset 4 sure. Not the other way around 
hihfrqt comment Isn't this where stable coins come in? Your borrow stable coin with your BTC as collateral.

https://celsius.network/crypto-loans for example let's you borrow 10,000 USDC ($10K USD fiat) for 0.65 BTC in collateral. You take out a loan, send your 0.65 BTC them, they give you stable coin that you convert to fiat etc, pay your monthly interest, and the at the end of the loan you pay them back 10,000 USDC at whatever the BTC to USDC rate is (hopefully higher!) In exchange for your 0.65 BTC back. 
hiha32f comment Then don't borrow BTC. Borrow fiat instead, and use it to buy BTC. 
hihpw67 comment Most likely won't be BTC the currency of the world, each country will have there own crypto, why will I give printing control to someone else. Shit will never change, best hope is that they don't kill crypto in the USA and keep it as a form of gambling. 
hihbnfw comment If you borrow 1₿, don’t convert all of it to fiat right away. That’s when the problem arise. It’s like borrowing some dollars and buying some shit stock that’ll definitely perform badly in the future. Same thing. Only convert when you know return is better than ₿. 
hii44ey comment Usury historically meant charging ANY interest at all.  Because they were on the gold standard.  Bitcoin is similar.  If the currency is "fully adopted", its value will grow as the economy grows.  So spending money on (say) a bakery is a bet that that bakery will produce more than the average growth in production.  To add interest on top of that is asking a lot of the baker. 
hiib0io comment No, and this is an issue with btc becoming a currency. 
hijjyry comment Unless hyperbitcoinization happens, people will still take out loans in their national fiat currencies and pay the loans back in said national fiat currencies.

If hyperbitcoinization happens, Bitcoin will be so thoroughly distributed and will have become so stable -- its purchasing power tracking the overall global economic expansion and contraction -- that rapid price rises won't be an issue.

After all, the whole point of loaning money out today is that you expect the borrower to repay you more value in return than inflation will destroy.  Otherwise, you wouldn't have made the loan -- you'd have put it into something else that would yield you a net gain.  You're putting your money at risk with the expectation that you will make more back.

Bitcoin goes down, I buy 
hihnx19 comment Op looks like a scammer trying to gain enough karma to lure his/her targets. 

~bitcoin is here to stay~

We know that, that's why we are here 
hihk0tw comment What’s the general prediction for the new low when the cycle is over? 
hihil22 comment Hope it runs down to 5k cuz 60k is over priced. Plus the cheaper it is the easy it is for new people to come in the crypto space. 
hihlj6a comment https://youtu.be/m2-0Q2mn11g

The bear low in 2023 should be $65,000, the prior mid cycle (bull) high. 
hihk8b6 comment lol it's never hitting 5k ever again 
hihnqak comment Those who didn't buy at 50k will not buy at 5k. They'll wait for it to dump more or think bitcoin is about to die. 
hiie6uu comment But it will be nice more easier to enter for new people 
hiie1vt comment They will buy when price skyrocket cuz they will fomo. Then strategic dump will come in and those people will sell at a lost. Rinse and repeat

qi7n27 submission Mt gox coins being released beginning Nov 20, 2020. 
hihlnot comment It remains to be seen, but if a lot of these coins will appear on the market at the same time, uniquely suppressing price, I’ll be there to vaccum up as much as I can. 
hihxne1 comment Really?  I haven't had an email to confirm this.  I'm up to date with all of the deadlines/requirements.  Last I heard was the vote on the rehabilitation plan. 
hihk5hk comment Who is waiting for their EmptyGox coins? 
hihy5l6 comment They aren't being released in november, a good chunk should be released sometime next year and there isn't a date set yet. 
hihmd50 comment Huge dump probably. Either people getting their coin and exiting with glee, or coins dumped to pay out claims in appropriate fiat of the country which the claimants are from. 
hihlx9d comment Its not clear how the btc will be distributed. 
hijmv6u comment Source? 
hihof2m comment Agreed. Thinking about how long ago Gox was, these folks might hold huge amounts of BTC. If I had been screwed around for years like those peeps, I would probably cash out as well. Not to mention the insane returns they should have right now. 
hik8piu comment Am creditor - see r/mtgoxinsolvency

[https://www.reddit.com/r/mtgoxinsolvency/comments/qf1v6i/payment\_quickly/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mtgoxinsolvency/comments/qf1v6i/payment_quickly/)

There will be more information from the trustee about the distribution timeline sometime in November. Creditors have two different options for payout - early lump sum & final payment which will happen later, so not all of the coins are going to be released at once anyway. Any gox related price discussion is fud at this point. 
hij3rmu comment we're only getting 21% for each coin and most people didn't have too much in there - yes there were some people with huge numbers but the average was less than 10 coins iirc. 
qi7o13 submission Thoughts on storing bitcoin on Exchanges/Custodians like Coinbase 
hihl1lt comment Cold storage. 
hihlfe4 comment Not your keys, not your Bitcoin. 
hihlh7f comment I wouldn't keep it in an exchange if you plan to hold long term. Not worth risking your investment on an exchange. 
hihm06n comment Golden rule in the Bitcoin world: Not your Keys, Not your Bitcoin.

You must take responsibility for the security of your Bitcoin. This is the only way to take full advantage of this revolution that aims to give power back to each individual over the fruits of their labor.

As a non-american, I have to wonder if you guys actually voted for that circus into town...? I am not even sure how I'm supposed to feel watching them bringing the collapse of US. 
hihm3ya comment if the govt taxes unrealised gain, they will allow unrealised losses.  that could mean there is more volatility in the market.

qi82us submission Sign up - Coinbase 
qi89ru submission Going down into the Bitcoin rabbit hole… 
hihnvp6 comment Learning about the reserve bank/federal banking system. Once you understand that, BTC is the only thing that makes sense. 
hihvmdn comment Lessons I learnt : 

How inflation is an invisible under-reported tax.

 How Central banking is a ponzi scheme. 

How the monetary system is designed to keep a few rent seekers and their cronies rich. 

And to keep us working hard to earn a pittance, then spend time and energy finding out what 'stocks are good to buy' 

How 'modern economists' with their talk shows and TV interviews have no fricking clue what's happening /what's going to happen but pretend otherwise.

Why bonds are essentially negative yield.

How equity markets barely maintain purchasing power for most retail investors. 

How I need to take personal responsibility for my assets. No government is going to take care of me and my own. The buck stops with me. 

What matters is, I make meaningful work that is valuable to society and get paid for it. I convert my savings to bitcoin (the only sound money there is). 

I've stopped wasting time on doing FA and researching stocks. I enjoy the time with my family and getting better at Life. 

After all, we only live once! 
hihoa9k comment I think one of the main insights for me was how permissioned and controlled our current money system is, and how much of a control/surveillance tool it can be (access to banking services is permissioned/surveilled, payments to certain services can be denied, inflation is a hidden tax etc). There is also no way to know what the monetary policy will be in 1y, 2y, 10y from now, as it is all controlled by humans and politics. 
hihvaaj comment Jeff Booth and his thoughts on inflation and tech and the environment, Greg Foss and his information about Debt and Risk, Yan  and Szabo and their info unforgeable costliness and it’s historical and current necessity, the history and future of Gold and money with Gromen and Saif, the monetary oppression and colonialism happening around the world with Gladstien, how energy is used with Nic Carter, what Money and power are with Saylor and Breedlove.  Pysh and his views on contango and how the rates of return in our digital world are going to wreak havoc on traditional markets once there is enough liquidity.  Lyn Alden and Trace Mayer about network effects. Gromen on the DOD and how money ties into our relationship with China.  & Jason Lowry and his insights on Bitcoin and force projection and how militaries will be less needed on Bitcoin.  How Bitcoin gets rid of moral hazard with Jimmy Song and Breedlove. 
hihrpac comment I’m losing money in my savings with inflation at 5.4%. It’s since been moved to Bitcoin and has been increasing nicely. Left some in savings for emergencies so I can weather the BTC swings 
hijdmni comment When you realize it’s your choice to move your excess energy (cash) from a clearly broken and unsustainable system that devalues your energy over time to one that simply promotes transparency and equality that can’t be manipulated and increases in value for everyone as the network grows 
hihzmah comment I have had several Bitcoin epiphanies in the last 6 years.

1. Learning about an emerging technology called Bitcoin and listening to Andreas Antonopoulos talk about this digital money and it’s future.

2. Learning about Bitcoin as a speculative asset and watching the value of Bitcoin go from $100 a coin to $1000 a coin after the 2016 halving and finally buying a small amount.

2. Going down the shitcoin rabbit hole, mining a few shitcoins and getting hacked and scammed and losing half my money. . . all while Bitcoin slowly grew in value.

3. Learning about Bitcoin the decentralized monetary network and putting the time in to understand the Network effect by holding a small amount of Bitcoin through the dizzying run up
of 2017 through the crypto winter of the next three years and then the second halving in May 2020 and seeing it’s value ultimately increase 8000%

4. In the last year, joining this Reddit community and the clubhouse community and asking lots and lots of questions about Bitcoin.

5. Finally learning about Dollar Cost Averaging and making small weekly purchases regardless of the price automatically for a year and seeing my investment grow 40% so far! 
hiiljcq comment Most recent mindfuck: Bitcoin could actually *solve* climate change **if** mining proves to be a profitable activity in the long term. I'm not even making this shit up. 
hiipepw comment I realized the government is deliberately against you and that can be seen with other industries (food, healthcare, education, etc.) 
hije4su comment For me it was learning about bitcoin relates to Austrian economic theory and the history of how and why gold transformed from a SOV to a medium exchange and unit of account globally.

Basically, when I read The Bitcoin Standard.  

Then, when I started to see that bitcoin mining was becoming a global industry and that states might start to compete for their business rather than banning.  It became clear to me that the incentive structure around bitcoin is truly genius.

When I learned about lightning and realized it has the potential to kill every transaction focused shitcoin.

I mean the list goes on. 
qi8bqe submission Bitcoin hodling rate reaches 9-month high, boosting hopes of ‘bull flag’ rally 
hihnnur comment tldr; The number of “hodled” and presumably lost Bitcoin tokens continues to surge in sync with the BTC price. The total number of lost/hodled Bitcoin exceeded 34% of its total supply of 21 million tokens, making the cryptocurrency more scarce. The amount of Bitcoin reserves held across all the crypto exchanges dropped to its lowest level since August 2018.

qi9qdo submission Is CryptoWhale on Twitter is a Scammer? 
hihupq8 comment We have a lot of newcomers entering the Bitcoin space recently who are exploring different exchanges and such. Some users are developing a habit of asking if various random websites some complete stranger PM'd them is a scam or not. Sometimes these sites are completely unrelated to Bitcoin. This is not the purpose of r/Bitcoin.

* Do not trust unsolicited messages telling you to check out some shady website.
* Do not trust Discord randos telling you that you won a prize.
* Do not trust anyone who promises guaranteed profits.
* Do not trust website with unpronounceable domain names
* Do not trust anyone claiming to give away free Bitcoin. (YouTube, Twitter, Discord)
* Do not trust anyone claiming they will double however much Bitcoin you send them.
* Do not trust 'pretty girls' on Tinder telling you about new investment opportunities.
* **If you have to ask** if some sketchy website or special offer is a scam, **then it probably is.**

You have to learn to think for yourselves. Recognize that there are many tricksters out there who will go to great lengths to separate you from your Bitcoin. Use your head and stay safe. If you send your Bitcoin to a scammer, it's gone forever. There are no refunds!
