qegtgm submission Question: is the idea that eventually a large amount of BTC will be on LN and most people will never actually touch BTC directly? 
hhsy0h8 comment I don't fully understand your post, sorry.

If you're asking whether the majority of people will not do transactions on the layer 1 blockchain in the future, almost certainly yes. When using bitcoin as a medium of exchange, obviously you are trusting the other party I guess, situationally. But this applies only to certain situations and could be likened to now as well.

When using bitcoin as just a store of value, you are the one holding your coins (ideally) so there is still no trust involved. 
hhsw8zl comment there is no singular idea. but lighting is bitcoin. 
hht8bf1 comment LN are basically bitcoin transactions, literally transactions you could put on-chain, with difference being if/when they are broadcast and ideally up to never becomes necessary for ideal case. You still control all the keys/data you need to control your coins and should the need arise you can broadcast them and put them on-chain to resolve any issues.

many modern bitcoin wallets keep bitcoins on LN and if they have to pay to on-chain address they just do atomic swap between layers called (reverse) submarine swap instead of closing the channel. e.g. breez 
hhtax3q comment I imagine LN channels will be settled on layer 1 from time to time and the durations will vary greatly.

LN is Bitcoin just like balances in bank accounts are money. 
hhu6405 comment My take is Joe Public's daily, weekly, monthly payments will be via a custodial lightning wallet. The base layer will function more as a savings account or a safe. 
hhvpt5r comment Lightning transactions are bitcoin transactions. Just that the open and close of the channel are what you play to bitcoin blockchain. LN is where you pass around and keep signed things that you choose not to play to the main chain unless the other side goes dark. Then the last transaction you have should be in your favor. 
hhuptw6 comment Not just LN.  There are also sidechains already.  Liquid, WBTC, and I've seen a couple more price quotes on CMC that I've never heard of but which seem to be the same sort of thing. 
hht7wpw comment This is the most correct statement. 
hhuflfi comment true. sidechains do frequently settlements in L1 as well

hht4ybf comment the first time i bought was at 63k earlier this year. Then it dropped and I bought a lot more, and now im sitting on close to 2x gains. If I didn't FOMO in, I wouldn't have started teaching myself about bitcoin -> i wouldn't have finally understood what a great thing it is -> I wouldn't have bought the dip. 

Never underestimate the power of FOMO. It did great things for me. 
hht6788 comment Is it too late? No one knows, but most people here don’t think so.  Maybe 100x days are behind, but 10x doesn’t seem too crazy in a few years.

Most people will recommend not leaving much coins on an exchange. I’d agree especially if you live in a politically volatile country.  Get a hardware wallet if you can or read about Electrum+Tails as a free option for Bitcoin.  There will be a transaction fee to send your coins to your wallet, but generally not too much.  You can bounce back and forth, but you pay a little each time so not advisable to do it constantly.  But during the learning process expect to pay a bunch of fees to learn right? 
hht1nyr comment You are not late at all, you're very early, you are not among the first adopters obviously but only about 2% - 5% of the world's population use or have used any form of crypto currency (5% is the highest estimate)

If you asked the average person about bitcoin they might have heard about it but they won't really know anything, you'd be lucky if they can remember it being on the news some time ago and most likely belive it's only used in the black market.

How many people on the street have you heard discussing the new and latest ATH or a recent 5% pullback?

After two days trading, BITO owns nearly 1,900 contracts for October and has amassed 1,400 November contracts. The CME is raising the ceiling to 4,000 contracts per month starting when November futures become the front-month.

*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.* 
hht0or7 comment My mom's been breaching that limit all year! 
hht54ha comment They can only hold a certain number of contracts at certain maturities. And the demand has been so great that they are close to that. This means they will need to take contracts further out which means the fund will likely not track the spot price very closely. 
hht5n3o comment Will that push the Bitcoin spot price higher or lower? 
hhuo88l comment > This means they will need to take contracts further out which means the fund will likely not track the spot price very closely.

Apparently it already won't, because they are allocating one third of their capital to US Treasury bonds.

How the fuck do they expect to "track" Bitcoin if they tie up 33% of their money in something that is paying 0.00005% interest? 
hht6urf comment Dunno. Possibly if the ETF drives up the contract premiums such that hedge funds and miners start hodling coins so that they can write the contracts.  But they can also just back those with cash if they think BTC will come back down or trade flat. I’m not sure what their risk tolerances are, but I guarantee there are desks and hedge funds working on finding arbitrage between BTC, BITO, GBTC, mircrostrategy, the futures, options, the miners, etc.  Personally, I think for the long term hodler this is all bullish. But short term 🤷‍♀️ 
hhvo1ic comment imho a future etf will lead to higher spot prices bc atm it attracs customers like my dad who would rather have an etf in his normal brokerage than the hassle of learning how btc and its wallets work.

if dad buys the future etf buys a futures contract from a bank. this bank needs to hedge the risks by buying spot btc. otherwise the bsnk would essentially be short on btc with unlimited downside 
qehan1 submission So I guess we’re just saying it out loud now 
qehcwk submission How do I get into mining? 
hht12ra comment Mining is an industrial size competitive business. You trying to bring a PC is like you competing with Exxon drilling for oil with a teaspoon. See bitmain.com for equipment prices.

All miners compete for 900 btc per day. The bigger your hashrate the more is your cut. If you want 1 BTC per month you can calculate how much hashrate you need. If you cannot do that by looking up equipment specs then you cannot possibly ever mine. 
hht3390 comment To be blunt, I might suggest just buying BTC outright with DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) instead of mining. Mining is not easy for a long list of reasons. I mine, but I got into it years ago when the price was below $3000. Still, it was excruciating to get a hold of a miner. Today, you will pay through the nose for an ASIC miner that can ROI in \~9 months. Mining with anything other than an ASIC miner is pointless. 
hht1xjc comment 1 BTC per month?

That's like asking if you can transport as many people across the US per month as a 747...in your Toyota Prius 
hhtndgk comment So, I think you get the picture that your question shows that you know very little (that's ok, you said that up front).  I have a couple resources for you to look at: 1) asicminervalue.com will show you how much each ASIC will mine per day (you will need to look at the sha256 miners for bitcoin).  2) coinbase.com where you could buy fractions of coins as opposed to mining.

Direct question, direct answer: you can't mine with a DIY setup, you must buy an ASIC. To get 1btc per month you will need about 5 bitmain s19 110TH which are going to cost about $15000 each ($75000).  And they will cost about $275 each (about $1400) per month in electricity.

hht7nkw comment Thank you much!
COTI is a  promissing cryptocurrency, they do good things, i follow this project already for half a year and dont regret as i am in profit.They issued debit cards via Simplex, so you can pay with your crypto right in the shop. I thought that it's very convenient and decided to register a Simplex account. Now i think twice before using it in case i receive this product. 
hhuqd4d comment So, in other words, you're doing all of this just to help promote a shitcoin that no one is actually using?

There are plenty of Bitcoin debit cards from reputable companies. 
hhx90i7 comment Haha, lol. no I am not in for promoting) I just wanted to receive a debit card because I have some staking earnings and it was suppposed to be much easier to use that money not transfering it to exchanges\\changing to fiat etc... Having your crypto binded to the card is very convienient.

But now actually I am in doubt whether it is worth doing at all...  the begininng of my communication with Simplex doesnt seem good.

No need to take it personally.   
Also, be aware that short sellers can have a stabilizing effect on the market to the extent that they are successful. They blunt the highs and the lows as they sell the former and cover on the latter.

hhtcw48 comment Go and make sure 2FA is turned on your account. Do not use sms or email 2fa. Use an app like authy or Google authenticator. 
hht37yt comment Whales and hackers are not the same thing, whales are just people with a lot of bitcoin. When you store your coins on Coinbase or any exchange then a hacker could get into your account and transfer your funds. If you keep your coins in a wallet then they would need your seed phrase or private keys. 
hht3al5 comment Whales are the ones who already have a lot of BTC. They don't steal.

Yes you should worry about your PC or phone getting hacked and also worry about Coinbase getting hacked. Coinbase could just move your btc and zero out your account and block logins at any time for any reason. You'd have to sue them to even get their attention, let alone get money back.

$50K is not a whale amount by far. 
hht4l8l comment Usually people end up trying to sign up for a promotion, or they think someone is helping them “fix” or “validate” their wallet and they enter their recovery words. 
hhtki7a comment Self custody as soon as it's more than you're willing to lose. 
hhu557t comment In addition to 2FA, enable address whitelisting, even if you never plan to withdraw Bitcoin to your own wallet. If someone gets access to your account and wants to withdraw your funds to their own wallet, with address whitelisting enabled they'd need to add their address to the approved list and wait 48 hours before withdrawing to it. Then check your email at least once each day so that you can freeze your account if an address is added that you didn't add. 
hhufjn4 comment Whales don't "steal" Bitcoin. What they do is attempt to using their buying/ selling power to manipulate the Bitcoin price - and in doing so triggering stop-losses and liquidating leveraged trades.

They then buy back Bitcoin at the cheaper price, thus accumulating more Bitcoin than the amount they sold. Naturally, this will likely include other people's liquidated positions.

So this isn't directly stealing. How do you completely protect yourself from this? Don't use stop-losses and don't use leveraged trading.

Hackers are completely different. How do you protect your Bitcoin? Buy a cold wallet and transfer your Bitcoin there. 
hhuyzw3 comment Yes, you should worry about getting hacked, and take appropriate steps to make yourself a small target.

My first piece of advice would be to get a hardware wallet, learn how to use it to secure your keys, and take custody of your Bitcoin.

If you *must* use Coinbase, consider using their Vault as well as app-based 2 factor authentication.

[https://www.coinbase.com/vault?\_\_cf\_chl\_captcha\_tk\_\_=pmd\_k7B7gZzGHwgbvwV4857DkDhQ13Lesa.\_Np88f1IUeT0-1635082482-0-gqNtZGzNAyWjcnBszQu9#features](https://www.coinbase.com/vault?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=pmd_k7B7gZzGHwgbvwV4857DkDhQ13Lesa._Np88f1IUeT0-1635082482-0-gqNtZGzNAyWjcnBszQu9#features)

Note that Coinbase recently had a severe vulnerability in their 2 factor authentication system that led to thousands of user accounts being drained:

hhvhufp comment Thank you, this was helpful. 

1) Will the newly created multisig wallet have it's own public address and private keys? 

2) The one signing wallet that has a balance (1/3), can send normally to the newly created multisig wallet as per usual?

3) Will the creation of the multisig wallet have ANY impact on the hardware wallets, other than simply turning them into signature (essentially all these hardware wallets can be used independently)?

4) Only the newly created multisig wallet will require 2/3 hardware wallets to sign? 

Clarity around these questions would be immensely appreciated. Thank you again! 
hhthxs7 comment I disagree. A single hardware wallet with one seed phrase is one single point of failure. A multi-sig setup that the user has tested and restored multiple times with geographically dispersed keys is 100x better.

hhtcal1 comment I found out about Bitcoin many years ago when a friend came to me with a dead hard drive and said all his money was on there. It was not recovered.  
From that day on, I save every hard drive I find in hopes of finding a forgotten wallet. 
hhty52z comment LPT: You will never find anything. 
hhur4qo comment It is going to be like shooting in the sand but maybe If you do it methodically it could work.  
1. Find out the main cities that were among the first to start using bitcoin. For example, bitcoin restaurants, atms, meet ups. It is hard but if you can you could start in those cities. 
2. Most people delete their drives before giving it away unless some one doesn't know about computers say a widow. Have advanced recovery software. 
3. Know you might fail, but it's the journey that counts. 
4. Start a recycling company using the thousands of computers stranded in your basement. 
hhtosw7 comment 3.7 mill coins lost! 
hhv55kv comment One thing you should know. SSD, rarely actually delete things. What happens is if you have a 100gb SSD HD, there is actually about 1TB. And then a memory controller tracks which sectors have been recently written to and changes it up. It does this for speed, and longevity, because unlike magnetic drives, you can only read and write to the same sector so many times. The nicer the SSD the higher the ratio of "spare" space to listed capacity will be.  And there are tools that can attempt to extract data from deleted sectors. There is a small class of SSD's typically sold to tue government that have true zeroization capabilities but those are way more expensive then what you find at best buy.    


The other reason to know this, is that if you have an SSD that you KNOW used to have a wallet and get deleted it may be worth actually pulling the IC's off the board.    

With magnetic drives there is some generic resonance left after deletion. 15 years ago there were companies that for about 40k could disassemble mag drives in a clean room and attempt to pull deleted data directly off the disk. Not sure if that is a thing anymore. 
hhtke37 comment Why waste your time? Life's too short. 
hhum99m comment James from InvestAnswers has done extensive research on this.  He just discussed it with Michael Saylor in his interview a couple days ago.  He estimates that 4,865,000 BTC have been lost.  The annual loss rate is 4% per year.

The link:  (https://youtu.be/-cx1Am2UFCA).  Around 27:30 mark. 
hhtkjke comment What do you search for on the hard drive, and where? How do you know if a wallet exists? 
qej2w0 submission Question about bitcoin. is there a way to keep it in "cash" in your wallet? 
hhtpe62 comment It sounds like you don't really understand what bitcoin is and how it works. Explain what you are trying to do. 
hhtoxnd comment Can you pull your car around with horses? 
hhtg8ab comment Bitcoin doesn't have accounts. If you keep bitcoin you keep bitcoin. If you keep fiat you have fiat but miss out on any price increases of bitcoin. You can sell bitcoin for fiat or an altcoin like USDC. There are fees for that. USDC doesn't appreciate, it stays $1 unless it crashes because its backing is shady. Avoid tether USDT - unbacked fraud.

If it's all very new to you bitcoin is a digital object that you can own. You can't convert it into anything. It cannot magically become fiat in a bank account. But you can buy or sell it. Tax implications are similar to stocks. If you sell bitcoin, or trade it for something, or pay for a stick of gum there is a taxable event. You'll have to report the sale and pay tax on gains, if any. See irs.gov. IRS knows about bitcoin. 
hhuj5m2 comment Write the seed on a $1 bill. 
hhtec8i comment >is there a way to keep it in cash in ur bitcoin account?

Keep what in cash? 
hhtee9v comment Keep it in usdc, it’s called a stable coin and stays around 1 US dollar.  Usually you can sell crypto for it like it is USD. 
hhtk892 comment Can you give us an example of your day to day life where you want to keep your wealth in bitcoin but you want the flexibility of cash?

The reason why i ask is because i think the strike app might help you but wanted to get more specifics from you first. 
hhtki24 comment Right, as mentioned you can put it in stablecoins, which would keep the asset in your crypto wallet. This is what people usually do when they want to sell bitcoin because they think it will go down BUT they don't want the cash because they are going to buy back in.  Typically there are fees for this kind of transaction as well but they are less than going between your crypto and a brick-and-mortar bank.

hhtgouu comment which comes frist hyperinflation or hyperbitcoinization? 
hhtwsm0 comment I've memorized my seed and passphrase in prep for the anarchy to come.  I sleep better at night knowing I can use it anywhere, anytime... to survive, and if I dream, to maybe prosper.

I wonder how I would transact using BTC to buy food etc to survive in a world with everyone trying to survive Hyperinflation and Hyperbitcoinization. I think the World will crave and do it all, to have Sats..We could live like oligarchs LOL. but...

What threats to my bitcoin and my safety would I have to contend with? Would the bitcoin community have to live together in secured estates, or to even buy a country or two?

With my meager amount, it will be a long time before I can afford a bunker in New Zealand.

Anyone know how things might be? 

Any time travelers present, past and future? DM me. 
hhw3gkc comment But there is so much bitcoin news already. What could fuel a 3rd wave?

What kind of hyperbitcoinization narratives will be around during this time?

Make your plans now, stick to your plans. 
hhwpw5z comment hyperbitcoinization happens because of competition with Bitcoin. 
hhx1cuz comment in a hyperinflationary event people will only switch to a new currency once the old currency becomes worse than the next best alternative 
hhu0u5c comment I think ,it's answer is probably hyperinflation.without that ,hyperbitcoinization have very chances. 
hhvb74i comment Uncertain, depends on the path ahead and which fiat currency we are talking about.

-	Hyperbitcoinization is the inflection point at which Bitcoin becomes the default value system of the world.  

-	Hyperinflation is typically described as more than ~50% inflation per month. As it can happen to any currency, I will presume we are talking about USD, the current king of fiat.

The true question is: what happens first, people start distrusting dollars or starts trusting Bitcoin as a currency?

In the meantime:

-	Federal Reserve can print more USD
-	BTC can be “banned” and manipulated
-	A new monetary reserve system can be created
-	US can get involved in new “fear triggers”, like wars
-	BTC can get “domesticated” by fake derivatives like gold was, making people distrust its potential as reserve

That said, hyperbitcoinization is a process that already started, how so:

In any cycle, mindsets start changing. Right now, we have about 1-3% of world population convinced that BTC is better than USD. This is an educated guess.

Following adoption models, like the Technology Adoption Lifecycle, we need about 16%-18% of people to change their minds about BTC. This is when any tech fails or crosses the chasm of adoption.

Then, it becomes inevitable. Some will say it’s already inevitable.

Hyperbitcoinization already happened in some minds, but it keeps rising slowly in waves. As it keeps going, it triggers more USD inflation as people sell their USD for BTC. 

If the FED does nothing to save USD (and maybe even if it does), inflation accelerates and becomes hyperinflation. 
hhunxu1 comment It comes after hyper inflation 
hhuypxy comment Before people will switch their main primary currency, there must be a problem with it.  I can tell, when I talk to people about Bitcoin, they just kind of shut down because there isn't any problem at the moment, with the $.  They can still buy things at the store with it, although there are a few empty shelves.  And they are getting paid in $ as well.  

Just like no one wants change except a baby with a dirty diaper, in order to get people to switch currencies there simply must be a problem with the old currency.  That's where hyperinflation comes in.  Then they will switch. 
qej6op submission "We believe the perception of bitcoin as a better inflation hedge than gold is the main reason for the current upswing," said JPMorgan. 
hhu2xb1 comment r/Bitcoin is not a Twitter mirror, especially not for scam sites. 
hhtn6kt comment We told them 4 years ago that bitcoin would go parabolic due the halvening and sinking dollar. Now they act shocked. 
hhtgan3 comment Study it and realize it’s not just perception. Bitcoin IS THE PUREST hedge against inflation ever bestowed upon man. It protects any investor from their government perpetually printing more Ben Franklins, making every $100 you already possess in your wallet less valuable. The entire way bitcoin was designed is to have already fractionalized each bitcoin so far using satoshis, that further “stock splits” to make it more available to any retail investor would be impossible. Even with a price tag of $400,000 dollars per BTC, a broke retail investor could own many satoshis. This paired with the fact that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin, mean the only way bitcoin will ever be able to store more money will be for the price per Bitcoin to go up accordingly. It will be 500k+ one day. A million isn’t impossible. With a 20 trillion market cap bitcoin would be 1 million per at current rates. Not impossible, nor far off, as it’s more than 5% the way there and growing..

hhtk9ra comment Bitcoin hasn’t been around for long enough to know if it’s a good hedge against inflation plus it’s very volatile. 
hhty79m comment Yeah.Seems obvious why.
Gold is devalued and its price is controlled via paper gold & manipulation.
Gold has lost its ability to fufil its main use case.
Its scarcity and real value.

Bitcoin is designed so this can't happen. The SAT (penny) is starting to drop. 
hhtgs6h comment Bitcoin is perfect code and will never fail, never suffer a block reorg, never be replaced by something better. Like.. it's completely infallible. Zero technical risk. Earth will never have power outages, never get hit with solar flares, never have EMP weapons used. Miners will continue to earn healthy revenue even when block rewards go to shit. There will be no price and hashrate death spiral. None of that? It's a done deal. It's as good as another thing that lasted for 150 million years - the dinosaurs - and nothing could stop their reign. Oh wait..

qekiv4 submission How Decentralized Identifiers And Bitcoin Fix The Web 
hhtnzo1 comment >"In recent weeks, key members of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), led by Mozilla, have stymied efforts to approve a web standard that would allow billions of people to privately and securely control their own data and identities. The proposal — now years in the making and mere months from the finish line — is known as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). These W3C members, in an egregiously opportunistic move, are protecting their own revenue streams, for themselves and for their political ideologies, at the expense of billions of people who would benefit from such a web standard." 
hhtp4zy comment tldr; On October 4, 2021, Facebook, along with WhatsApp and Instagram, disappeared from the internet. This comes amid reports that 1.5 billion people allegedly had their personal data stolen from Facebook and posted for sale. Facebook has long maintained a culture that “chose to optimize for its own interests” over what was good for the public. Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) can solve all of these issues.

hhtuw8g comment Gary Gensler made over $100 million as a banker and has banker buddies to protect.  That's why we don't have a spot Bitcoin ETF.  I don't think there will ever be one under Gensler.  He thinks that a futures ETF with terrible qualities and 10%+ yearly fees is him protecting investors. 
hhtw2at comment tyranny 
hhu64yh comment gary gensler says the underlying asset needs to be stable and not manipulated. he thinks bitcoin futures contracts are more stable and less manipulated than pure bitcoin. 
hhuoct2 comment Wall Street. 
hhuv3gk comment Unpopular opinion  scratch that fact!  Even if a purely bitcoin ETF is created there is nothing that can be done to independently verify the outstanding shares and therefore creates another attack vector by Wall Street to further dilute bitcoin value by creating additional shares (remember gme?). That and the whole counterparty risk thing.

At the end of the day there is no equivalent to owning your own keys and running your own node to send, receive, and verify your own transactions to be a truly self sovereign individual. That's the whole point IMO (taking the power away from the banks and giving it to the people). Don't trust, verify! It's the only thing that you can after all with true mathematical certainty. 
hhtw51g comment tldr; Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are investment funds that track a basket of assets on the stock market and can be traded in the same manner as regular stocks. While there are ETFs for just about any asset, the problem with crypto is that there is still uncertainty among regulators about how to define Bitcoin.

*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.* 
hhwzggh comment Was actually surprised nobody here In this thread has actually replied with correct answer. The reason is because with real bitcoins in the underlying ETF it proposes risk that that given fund could be hacked one day and all the underlying investors money is gone with no way to fix the problem. With regulated futures contracts around bitcoin there is 0% chance they have any bitcoin ever get stolen. All they have to do is keep some accounting straight to pull it off. 
hhubb5h comment The best customer protection is the narrative we tell for year.

**Don't invest more that you can afford to lose. Think long-term, at least 5 years, 10 years still better.**

Anyone who followed this advice has made a fat profit. If SEC simply joined this narrative it would be the best investors' protection ever.

The truth is they don't want us to buy actual bitcoin. Privileged want it solely for themselves.

hhuo6wf comment DCA until I get my 1 coin 
hhv2gj9 comment I am in the departures lounge and I heard the people at the next table talking about gold and silver and then sure enough I heard the word bitcoin. I took off my headphones to eavesdrop on them properly. One of them explained to the others that he had mined 5 or 6 coins on the dark web 15 years ago. He went on a long ramble, bitcoin was originally private and was only made public 5 years ago, he had 200 coins at one point but lost them and only had 10 or 12 left on a hard drive somewhere, he needed to check.

A load of bullshit obviously and I wonder if there was any grain of truth in anything he said, if he ever owned any coins. One of the other people at the table said that he had once passed up on an opportunity to buy coins at 30 cents each.

qeombs submission BTC price control 
hhugsn5 comment The answer is that the BTC price is clearly manipulated by large players in the industry. I would not worry too much about the creation of the stable coins, in the end it wont make any difference.

The flash crash on binance us was reported to be an issue with one seller dumping 500+ btc as a market order. The exchange does not have any restrictions like traditional exchanges so the order book ate all that bitcoin. 
This shows a couple of things, bitcoin is easily manipulated (if you have the btc ) and the market is free to go wherever it wants.

You could argue that this is a good thing as in the end the bitcoin price will return to reality and manipulation can only be short lived. But its clear that people will lose to the manipulators if they try to play thier game. 

I think once we have more decent decentralized exchanges that allow self-custody while trading then we will see more people move from the big exchanges and they will be forced to clean up thier crappy practices.

hhuir1b comment Good POV. Thanks for the reply. 

I think so too in terms of manipulations. People will ALWAYS lose to that, and this is one of the main reasons why i stopped trading BTC. Only investing in alts mainly and trading different assets other than crypto in general.

Besides that, how can you trust reports coming from binance when they’re the ones being part of the whole game? Either you trust them or you dont, and that applies to all other centralized exchanges imo.

hhudys0 comment

Sorry to be the wet blanket but this is a myth, nothing else. 
hhud611 comment > According to an analysis in a 2013 article, the number of coins held by Satoshi Nakamoto is 1,148,800.  

Not true: https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ppwf5u/do_you_think_satoshi_has_an_exit_strategy/hd6piyg/  

> There is evidence that the first 36,000 blocks of the Bitcoin network were all mined by the same computer  

That's also not true at all. There were multiple people running nodes/mining right from the beginning. Just a few hours ago there was an interview released with the person who (probably) was the 2nd node on the network, just few hours after the first software version was released: https://stephanlivera.com/episode/314/  

The first version of Bitcoin software didn't even start mining until it was connected to at least one other node, so all that "evidence" you speak about is bs (plz no offense, it's a commonly perpetuated myth/misunderstanding). 
hhupsvz comment He only mined in the beginning to maintain a certain hash rate which secure the network. If he was good, he would have waited a couple months or years for enough new miners to come online before he personally mines again. (Assuming SN wasn't a group) 
qeovte submission Why Governments Are Wary of Bitcoin 
hhuxw1w comment States consider that monetary creation should remain their sole responsibility. History has shown that central bankers cannot be trusted to use this power of money creation wisely and thoughtfully.

In history, it is only recently that the states have recovered this power.

The people must regain power over their money. Bitcoin is the solution invented by Satoshi Nakamoto to allow the people to fight against the states by taking back control of their lives.

It is obvious that such a paradigm shift scares the powerful people at the head of the current system.

They don't want to accept the idea that a more just and inclusive system for the majority could emerge. Yet they will have to come to terms with it, because you cannot stop an idea whose time has come.

Bitcoin's time has come. Its success is inevitable. 
hhuf183 comment tldr; Some governments fear that bitcoin can be used to circumvent capital controls and money laundering. Bitcoin users don’t need the existing banking system. The currency is created in cyberspace when so-called "miners" use the power of their computers to solve complex algorithms that serve as verification for bitcoin transactions. If bitcoin or another cryptocurrency becomes widely adopted, the entire banking system could become irrelevant.

qeoy8e submission How can the generation of vanity addresses be performed without having to compute public addresses from scratch for each tried private key? How can the brute-force algorithm be improved beyond trying a bunch of private keys? 
hhvibn4 comment Addresses are one time use identifiers. I guess you know now. 
hhupv12 comment VanityGen (and the OCL version, afaik) had optimizations to greatly improve performance by taking advantage of some shortcuts in the prvkey -> pubkey step. I don't know the technical details of that but the code is open and on github so if you're really interested you could start there. I do recall it was much faster than any other utils when the target address was prefix only. 
hhuf4xf comment That's what the generator has to do.

You can create a fancy functional address like the "1bitcoineater.." address, but it would not have a known private key.

Addresses are one time use identifiers. I don't write my name on toilet paper squares. I use them once and done with them. 
hhwu14j comment ECC public key generation is a trapdoor function - fast in one direction only. This means that brute force is the only method for discovering a Bitcoin address with a pre-specified prefix  

Also, an address is a RIPE160 hash of a SHA256 hash. These hashing algorithms are also trapdoor functions  

If you want a burner address, simply choose a 160-bit bitstring with the appropriate leading bits to manipulate the base58 characters at the beginning of the address  

In the burner address, the 160 bits is not the RIPE hash of a SHA2 hash of a public key, so the private key is not known, and the coins will be forever unspendable  

Some examples:

    bitcoin-tool --input-type address --input-format hex --output-type address --output-format base58check \
    --input 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
    bitcoin-tool --input-type address --input-format hex --output-type address --output-format base58check \
    --input 000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
    bitcoin-tool --input-type address --input-format hex --output-type address --output-format base58check \
    --input 000000000000000000000000000000000000000002
    bitcoin-tool --input-type address --input-format hex --output-type address --output-format base58check \
    --input 000000000000000000000000000000000000000003

hhz60jx comment I think we are following the same university course on blockchain technologies.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAGWJjZr9EE&ab\_channel=BillBuchananOBE this guy taks about outsourcing vanity adress generation and what struck me is the very last thing he says; on how a miner can generate lots of key pairs in advance 
hhvgk4p comment If someone was able to generate a vanity address with a certain prefix, what stops people to just try to generate the same address and stole your funds? the rest of the address? 
hhugt4j comment > You can create a fancy functional address like the "1bitcoineater.." address, but it would not have a known private key.

6 characters or less is perfectly doable.

> Addresses are one time use identifiers.

That is just best practice. Nothing prevents you from reusing the same address as many times as you wish. 
hhv8d1a comment Sorry Smoothgoing but you’re talking about burner addresses. With burner addresses if you send bitcoin to it it’s most likely gone forever. The OP is talking about vanity addresses where people can access their bitcoin. Basically a computer generates random addresses and statistically they eventually get something that spells a word or something of interest. 
hhz99x3 comment After giving it some tought don't think the keeping of key pairs in advance is something that is that usefull other than not having to generate them over and over when trying key combinations for a different vanity request. brute forcing will always be required but can be outsourced \[and that is my final answer\]. 
hhvxppy comment Each additional character you fix in the address multiplies the amount of work you have to do by 58. If you fix the entire address, you'll be working for much longer than the sun has left in its lifetime. 
qeoyva submission Will S2FX model break after mass adoption? 
hhuia5v comment PlanB said he is expecting it to break after 2024, before 2024, before S2F number reaches 100 (which is the number of Gold now), he has something to base on. After 100, in 2024, when BTC is projected to reach 1M/coin, there is no popular asset the world has ever seen reaching that S2F 100 range so he has no idea what would happen after. 
hhuez5s comment This post was created with the intention of debate. 
hhuhpyl comment Plan B just changes his model to force it to make it fit.

It should not be taken seriously 
hhufda8 comment Do you mean stock to flow model? It's literally in the name. Ratio of existing supply to new supply. Nothing at all about demand. Nothing at all about anything else in the world. It's so dumb maybe dude's kid nephew came up with it.

It's hard to even call it a model. It's like modeling a car but only with a radio. No engine. No wheels. No pedals. No seats. Nothing. But.. you get 8000 satellite radio channels on it, so it must drive good. And you are now asking about fuel economy. Uhm, it's some mpg but without fuel tank it's hard to know. 
hhuzelp comment It will break when the flow is greatly reduced after the next halving.  Basically there is little flow (additional BTC) added due to the block award dropping in half. This will, formula wise take the model above the 100 stock number. None of the other assets that have used the s2f model have gone over 100. Hence the breakdown to compare with other assets which is an underlying factor in the PlanB Bitcoin model. 
hhv9se1 comment The model works because he can interpolate between various SF assets at different valuations. But as we surpass gold at 10T there are no more "bookends" to compare too (possibly real estate at 100T but it's not fungible) that means you now have to extrapolate the data ie look behind rather than comparing to what's ahead....this is when it breaks down.....I think by that time you will have global adoption at the nation state level and the USD will be totally dead. 
hhvfuo1 comment It doesn’t work today, so what are you expecting to debate? The guy who created the model updates it so that it always matches what happened in the past. I can predict the past with 100% certainty too… 
hhvql5n comment The S2FX model is an incredibly dumb (i.e. simple-minded) model, so it’s very likely to break at some point. A better model is a log regression like the kind that Benjamin Cowen does

hhui4rm comment Nothing is linear with the price of Bitcoin.

A new ATH was reached during the week, and it is logical that the market will correct afterward to cool down.

A sideways consolidation will take place before the advance towards $100K resumes.

For those who are panicking, just remember where we were on October 1st: the price of Bitcoin was then $43K. A +55% increase has taken place in 20 days.

The best thing to do is to stay calm and wait patiently for the phenomenal things this market has in store for us in the coming weeks.

Patience always makes a difference with Bitcoin. 
hhuj68g comment tldr; Bitcoin hit its All-Time High (ATH) of $66.9K on Wednesday, October 20, 2021. This represents a +55% increase in the price of Bitcoin in just 20 days. The launch of the first Bitcoin ETF, based on futures contracts, obviously played a big role in achieving this new ATH. However, such bullish surges often give way to corrections.

qeppy4 submission The lack of privacy on bitcoin is concerning to me 
hhuj8br comment There is a hard trade off between full privacy and easy verifiability (anyone needs to be able to verify that Bitcoin's ruleset hasn't been breached and other fundamental things). Bitcoin's design is skewed towards the latter. "No privacy" is not really correct though, as the protocol doesn't know your identity (nor does it need to).  

So the case is a bit more nuanced than you suggest :)  

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Privacy 
hhuow34 comment Why are you so concerned? You couldn't possible tell me how much BTC I have. 
hhuljw8 comment It is as private as you want it to be. If you use an exchange that implements KYC and they leak your data your crypto info is known to the world. 

Lightning offsets this with taproot and onion routing making it a lot harder to see whats going on.

It is actually a great model when you think about it. Anyone who uses lightning for average daily transactions  and average balances has complete privacy on lightning and anyone with large wealth like corporations and nation states have transparent auditability on chain.

Instead of the elite and nation states having privacy while the masses do not it will be flipped to the elite and nation states being publicly auditable while the masses have privacy. 
hhule31 comment Your transactions are private. Some one would have to know your wallet number as well as what height and block it was sent for them to truly “find you” which takes effort 
hhup7ry comment Bitcoin is a public ledger. 
hhupxt6 comment Bitcoin is not anonymous and bitcoin was never meant to be anonymous. Bitcoin is pseudonymous. But there are other protocols that bitcoin bitcoin user can utilize to gain privacy. A few good examples are the lightning network, coinjoin, coinswap, and cross chain atomic swaps. The lightning network protocol was made so that users can perform fast bitcoin transactions for a negligible fee and another benefit is that observers cannot track bitcoin payments on the lightning network. Schnorr signatures and taproot will activate in November which will increase privacy, enable users to perform coinswaps, and allow the aggregation of multiple signatures of a transaction into one. This means that multiple signers can produce a joint public key and then jointly sign with a single signature. Schnorr signatures and taproot will also enable users to use musig2 which enables aggregating public keys and signatures. It will also enable point time locked contracts which will improve the privacy of bitcoin transactions over the lightning network. Wasabi Wallet allows users to perform coinjoins with very large anonymity sets, and users can even perform multiple coinjoins in a row. Wasabi Wallet 2.0 will be released next year (possibly even this year) and it will have the option to automatically coinjoin all of the bitcoins in a users wallet, and Wasabi Wallet 2.0 will no longer have the minimum requirement to coinjoin, and it will also be using the new and improved WabiSabi coinjoin framework that will allow even more inputs into a single coinjoin. Schnorr signatures also makes multi-signature and single-signature transactions indistinguishable on the blockchain so that an observer is not able to tell if a multi-signature transaction, a coinjoin, a cross chain atomic swap, or any other privacy enhancing action has taken place by viewing bitcoin transactions on the blockchain.

qepurs submission Mt Gox 144000 BTC in 26 days won't crash the market 
hhukvv0 comment The crux of this is that to crash the price BTC would have to be sold. 

The assumption that everybody is going to sell their BTC the moment they get it back is faulty - we have no idea how many creditors will sell, or when. If anything the fear of a coordinated selloff is more likely to impact the price.

Either way, pop some offensively low buy orders in and if you're very lucky you'll get some cheap BTC.

Also, point 1 is non-sense: there were polls on the insolvency sub, and it's generally close to 50/50 between HODL and selling right away.

After two years maximum you can no more loose. Then you continue to make profits on your BTC forever.
