qdtu99 submission The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF has over $2 billion in assets after just 4 days 
hhouw55 comment Too bad that money didn't go into actual Bitcoins to drive up the price. 
hhorf8z comment Shouldn't it already have had the assets when it sold its shares? What did people buy shares of, thin air? 
hhowxep comment Where is the 3rd regular at? 
hhoxl1o comment tldr; The first Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) was approved to trade publicly in the United States on Tuesday. The Winklevoss twins, of Facebook fame, filed for the first Bitcoin ETF way back in 2013, but the offering was rejected by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) because it felt that Bitcoin markets were susceptible to market manipulation.

hhqb7vt comment People just hold bitcoin in a hard wallet no need for ETF  Bitcoin. 
hhqvwwn comment This is not good. ETFs are not the actual thing and can easily be controlled which centralizes a decentralized asset such as Bitcoin.  This is a move by the Money Changers to control BTC and make money using a Ponzi scheme. 
hhtcj5i comment Poetic justice: The proshares ETF is a second-rate product.

The real bitcoin ETF will do $2 billion on its first day and SEC knows it. 
hhozhx4 comment I'm super sketched out, not by the ETF but the media coverage. They are pumping this thing so goddamn hard. Ofc, the real deal is the only thing I hold not some token promise bs with wall street bankers rubbing their hands all over it. 

Inb4 it turns out this was a scam ETF that doesn't buy actual bitcoins?

qdvpsd submission One of a friend sent me this platform ! Is it legit or a scam? Can’t download from the app. Have to go through phone setting 
hhp4eh8 comment We have a lot of newcomers entering the Bitcoin space recently who are exploring different exchanges and such. Some users are developing a habit of asking if various random websites some complete stranger PM'd them is a scam or not. Sometimes these sites are completely unrelated to Bitcoin. This is not the purpose of r/Bitcoin.

* Do not trust unsolicited messages telling you to check out some shady website.
* Do not trust Discord randos telling you that you won a prize.
* Do not trust anyone who promises guaranteed profits.
* Do not trust website with unpronounceable domain names
* Do not trust anyone claiming to give away free Bitcoin. (YouTube, Twitter, Discord)
* Do not trust anyone claiming they will double however much Bitcoin you send them.
* Do not trust 'pretty girls' on Tinder telling you about new investment opportunities.
* **If you have to ask** if some sketchy website or special offer is a scam, **then it probably is.**

You have to learn to think for yourselves. Recognize that there are many tricksters out there who will go to great lengths to separate you from your Bitcoin. Use your head and stay safe. If you send your Bitcoin to a scammer, it's gone forever. There are no refunds!

hhphxgf comment Can someone explain to me the benefit of multisig if you’re not sharing your stack with multiple people?

A company owned wallet that requires a unanimous vote to sell funds? Sure.

Someone leaves an inheritance for their 4 kids? Okay.

But what about a simple cold storage wallet for you and maybe an SO? Seems like a good way to lose access to your coins since each “copy” is unique.

Say you have a 2/3 multisig wallet vs 3 backups of your seed. If something happens to 2 copies you’re screwed, vs with the regular backups you’ve still got one left. 
hj3w9zu comment Case is a great training ground for multisig. You can then move onto using your own setup if you choose. 
hhpbedu comment Thank you! 
hhpk7rz comment >Say you have a 2/3 multisig wallet vs 3 backups of your seed. If something happens to 2 copies you’re screwed, vs with the regular backups you’ve still got one left.

I suppose you were meant to say lose 2 copies, and by that you mean they are destroyed, e.g., lost to a fire.

Multi-sig is useful when you consider the possiblity of losing your backup(s) *to other people*. With single-sig, losing one copy and you lose your coins. With a 2-of-3 multi-sig, losing one seed and your coins are still safe. 
hhqae9l comment [deleted]

hhutrh5 comment Who the fuck would go to a movie theater when *someone might sneeze* and kill everyone in the entire building with the WuFlu?!?!? 
hhzk5ea comment Yes, 100%. The bigger picture is that the Bitcoin space will gain significant credibility as popular and familiar/household companies start accepting payments this way. It's all part of the domino effect, imo.

At this stage, those who want to hodl for dear life can carry on no problem as others in the space will continue to lay the ground work. Sentiment around SoW will change (it's already starting to happen from many Bitcoiner convos I've recently read on Twitter) and people will start seeing Bitcoin as more than a store of wealth. 

As we all know, it was designed as "electronic cash" but it's that age old situation that nothing happens overnight (except price movements haha). I think that companies accepting Bitcoin now will be perceived as early movers by Bitcoiners who get it and then again in the future when Bitcoin is more widely understood by the masses. 
hhpux1y comment Yes, we need to wait until the end of the year to know the final result 
hhpv0f6 comment I can think of it as such, but it should be good for us if crypto become popular

qdwtki submission What should I do with a crypto wallet that has been shared with a scammer ? 
hhpgju5 comment >Is anyone familiar with this mining scam? 

This is just a scam. You just gave someone your money. There is no mining involved. 
hhpcmsy comment If you got any money in there, move it to a new wallet for 1. Otherwise just never use that password again, and forget the wallet ever existed, you should
Be fine. 
hhq0tsv comment Assume everything is compromised.

You should reformat all the devices you used during this time (to remove trojans), change your passwords and emails associated with any services (because the attacker may already have access), add 2FA on everything (not phone based).

Change banks and phone numbers to be safe.

Obviously don’t use the compromised seed. 

Subscribe to services that alert you in case your information is used to take out a loan or similar identity theft.

This is a lot of work, but it will help you reduce the chances of further attacks by a lot and you will sleep better. Otherwise your info is out there and could be sold and resold to other attackers. 

Before you get back into crypto, learn first security procedures and use a hardware or multisig wallet. Don’t use Windows. 
hhqeglu comment I don't know how to say this, but looks like this whole internet thing might be just too dangerous for you. Sorry for your loss.

I don't want to hear "but that wouldn't make sense if you understand Bitcoin, that would be stupid!!", because we already know law makers don't understand Bitcoin yet still have authority, and exist in every country. There are tons of stupid laws that get arbitrarily enforced and only make the news sometimes.

IF "it working" means that in just a few years the price shoots up 300% then i'm all for this kind of manipulation. 
hhq02t0 comment It doesn't say that they manipulated, it says they created an instrument for shorting it. I believe the real danger would be an instrument for inflating it, like fiat.

qdx5pq submission A parabolic blow off tops is less likely this cycle for BTC. 
hhpey6v comment I can agree. As a long time investor, the fast parabolic mania pumps are exciting. But we need a long slow run up for it to sustain your thesis. That’s the correct and healthy way to do. When the leverage/funding gets crazy in euphoria along with paper hands and whales you get blow off tops. Just like cooking a bratwurst low and slow will win the race. 

Also, there are so many more people in this now. Crypto advertising everywhere. Even with a blow off top, I could see there being basically no bear market. Also the larger the market cap the less volatile it should be. Nice post 👍🏼👍🏼 
hhq4dra comment I think its simply too early to tell if this will be the case or not. 
hhq0a0x comment I agree. And the good thing is, that this makes a 90% crash very unlikely as well. 
hhqi2a0 comment $100,000  by Xmas 
hhqeudf comment It takes more money to move the market each time, so of course it should be less steep of an increase. 
hhqg3pu comment Volatility is going to decrease as the market gets bigger that's just a fact, but everyone is saying this.. "this time it's different", "this time there's the big institutional investors".. which just makes me skeptical that there won't be the usual fomo-driven rise in price followed by a blow off top. 
hhq7gya comment Ok so this time its different 
hhqia00 comment A whale fat fingered us to 8k for an instant, I imagine insane volatility with rewards for those cool as a cucumber 
hhq06ru comment The fact that everyone keeps saying the same thing makes me doubt that thing will happen.

However, maybe it's just that obvious.

Who knows, we'll see! 
hhq3wnr comment I had made the same argument in this [post](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/iiec4v/why_i_am_still_bullish_on_bitcoin_after_hodling/)I made 14 months ago. 

> first point, there will be no parabola like late 2017, where btc price went 4x in about 4 months. 4x price action in such short range, will not happen, Because there are many exchanges like bakkt and cme, which allow shorting of btc. Which means that price action will not be drastic.

hhpoki9 comment Just want you all to be reminded that the rainbow chart is pretty accurate and I believe it will still be relevant going forward. its good to be aware of where you are relevant to what the range of your time period is. 

Knowing that a reasonable price for bitcoin at the end of this month is $15k so buying now has some risk, but knowing a reasonable price for the end of the month is also $170k buying at now’s price has some serious upside potential as well.

hhporew comment We are the United States. We don’t stop doing something because it’s wrong. We keep doing the wrong thing until it turns out right. 
hhpplkn comment Justify? What is this word, justify you speak of? 
hhr9xko comment USA is able to get away with this because it is still the dominant world power, economically and militarily.

The USA has enough international geo-political influence to coerce other countries and institutions into colluding with the IRS and the US gov to rat out, imprison, and/or extradite individual American expats/foreign nationals.

USA has pretty much always had citizenship based taxation, but it became even more authoritarian when FATCA and FBAR was introduced in 2010... it basically made it impossible for American citizens abroad to have any sort of financial privacy with their foreign financial/banking institutions.

&#x200B;

The only other country that has CBT is Eritrea, but they cannot practically enforce it as they do not have the geopolitical leverage to get other countries cooperation. This is why USA is effectively the only country in the world with CBT.

&#x200B;

In any case, if you seek to claim some semblance of actual freedom in this world... and not the fake "freedom" that American's think they have... renunciation of US citizenship is the first thing to do. You may be hit with an exit tax, or not - it depends on your financials. And then you can finally live without CBT going forward. 
hhqfias comment Not just US citizens. Applies to green card holders as well. 
hhqwz2i comment We can talk about the American long arm approach to taxes, but let's leave McAfee out of it.  There's way too much shit in that story to sort out whats real and fake.

hhpsf3v comment Perhaps 
hhq11pn comment You should only pay taxes to whatever place you also receive the benefits from it (e.g., infrastructure, social welfare, etcetera). One of the members of my board is American and every year I am amazed when she has to file taxes locally and in the US. I asked why she just doesn't renounce her us citizenship, but she said that's even more expensive (no clue if that bit is true or why it would be).

However, if you earn a lot of money in a country where you are not a resident off, you should pay local taxes on that income (morally right and pretends a part of tax evasion).

The only thing that made me contemplate bitcoin was that El Salvadore (or some county like that) Is now accepting bitcoin so naturally I thought if they are doing it, it's only a matter of time before other countries follow. I know that is a immature strategy but nowhere in high-school or college did they teach me financial planning.

hhrex23 comment can anyone suggest a good portfolio tracking app that doesn't require an email address to sign up?? 
hhsyqww comment Can you say "crap security"? 
hhrudtj comment If it's a mobile app it'll have access to whatever account information is available, including your email. You could potentially sideload it, rather than using an app store, but that's even less secure 

So that leaves desktop and web apps.

Personally I wouldn't install anything untrusted on my laptop so that leaves webapps... which will need some mechanism for creating an account, password resets, spamming you with GREAT OFFERS!!! etc.

There are services like tempmail (or something like that, I'm not recommending a specific service here, they're all a bit questionable) that create a random short-lived email address, but that involves a) trusting them and b) not forgetting your password.

It's far, far easier to just create a throwaway email account with one of the regular providers, and only ever use it for that service.

If you want an additional layer of security, use a VPN and create it within a VM, making sure to use an OS + browser you don't normally use, at a screen resolution you don't normally use, and masking your machines real hardware in the VM. That eliminates most of the easy browser fingerprinting techniques.

Or you could run your own mail server, doing the above.

Or you could just sign up with your regular email address and a unique strong password. That's probably fine too. 
qe00bw submission Can Wall Street funds manipulate Bitcoin price for Bitcoin Futures ETF? 
hhpwfi2 comment Yes they can, but as many shorts there will be as many longs; with BTC adoption to add to it, there is only one way BTC can go. Up. 
hhqkmht comment No, they can't. That's not posible with Bitcoin. Gold is a different story, it is controlled because they own it and also they can fake the numbers and hide the gold, also no audits, complete obscurity.

Bitcoin is auditable by anybody, it's a transparent public ledger. We need to stop the ETF FUD.

Bitcoin is a real accountable scarcity for the very first time ever.

> If they sell ETF shares without buying the underlying futures they can go bankrupt or at least be fined as soon as it is found out. Then another ETF provider who simply follow the rules will take their market share and the easy fees they get for such an easy service. And it is possible to reasonably easily verify that because the futures are traded on CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) and the open interest data is publicly available.
> 
> This is very different from gold because in the case of gold the best you have is the WORD of multiple private institutions saying the gold is there is in some vault. BlackRock, BNY Mellon, JP Morgan can provide whatever certificate they would like, you need to believe them. 
> 
> In the case of futures BTC, it is virtually auditable by anyone. Even a spot ETF of bitcoin is more risky in this case because, unless the issuer publicly discloses the address(es) where the bitcoins are, this is difficult to verify. One of the main reasons, I believe, for the SEC to allow for this type of ETF rather than the spot ETF is precisely this point.


https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/qcle7k/the_second_us_bitcoin_etf_is_set_to_start_trading/hhh3ydo/ 
hhpwf0j comment On October 11, a buyer or a group of buyers entered an order on a centralized exchange to buy $1.6 billion worth of bitcoin. To put it in perspective, that’s roughly 4.5% of the average daily volume in the Bitcoin spot market over the past two previous months (from the 11th).

That much supply hitting the market in under five minutes (13:11 to 13:16 UTC Wednesday) is a lot to jam into any one exchange (or three). It almost immediately sent bitcoin prices skyrocketing 5% to roughly $55,500.

It’s entirely plausible and not limited to Wall Street. All you need is a few bucks…

I know Robert Kiyosaki is both loved and hated, but he invested millions in gold exploration and mining in China only to have the government nationalize, (euphemism for steal) his gold mining operations once it looked profitable. 

I also know everyone was rattled by Elon Musk’s blustery comments earlier in the year, but when he said that too much mining was taking place in China, threatening bitcoin’s claims of decentralization, I think he had a point. Bitcoin mining will never again happen at the scale it did before in China and that’s a very very good thing

> Transactions explicitly state the amounts of the UTXOs they create, but the amounts of the UTXOs they spend can only be found by looking at the previous transactions that created those UTXOs.

However, as we all know, UTXOs are always fully spent. So what is this talking about? It sounds like they're saying the fee on the transaction can't be known just by looking at the inputs and outputs of the transaction. That's just not true from any angle I can look at it. What am I missing?

hhqi9wf comment Just put it in a safebag. Debasafe or debatex. 
hhqm3gl comment I use thermoplastics (ABS, from 3D printer filament). Melt in a pot, repeatedly dip into it for a nice coat, let cool completely, perfectly sealed. You can also do a cold method by melting the ABS in acetone, doing the same dip but cold, and then letting the acetone dry/evaporate, leaving a nice plastic coating. Much better than nail polish, pretty much a LEGO shell around anything you want.

If you're less fancy, the same thing works fine with candle wax. 
hhqql81 comment This is a good concept. I would consider just buying some tamper evident stickers and avoid the extra work. 

If you place them in the right spots you will know if it was tampered as the stickers change or destroy to show.

qe1xo0 submission Protecting yourself from the risks of KYC 
hhqdsep comment >  I'm just being paranoid and it is fine for me to buy at reputable exchanges like most others.

You are not paranoid. There are enough documented cases to justify your fear. 


Centralized exchanges don't really care about KYC, central planners use the threat of violence that demands them to create these Orwellian systems that put people in real risk. 

If exchange operators won't comply, central planners will send people to kidnap them and throw them in cages, in human zoos.

Not hard to imagine exchanges getting hacked and your info leaked. Which will make you into a possible target. When you upload selfies to exchanges, give your information you are literally putting your life in danger. 

Not to mention the general humiliation that comes with taking cringe selfies.

But that what central planners want, complete and total control over people, they want us to be in constant state of fear. To humiliate, to take away our privacy, our freedom. 
hhqw80o comment Source your bitcoin anonymously, and avoid KYC shitholes.

You can find (overpriced) atms or just buy person to person.

Generally, it will cost you a premium, because you are paying to avoid the thieves and gangsters who push AML/KYC, and that has a cost. 
hhsfwv0 comment >I have considered non-KYC exchanges such as Bisq or Hodl Hodl, but are a little scared off by the increase in complexity when buying. I don't want to make expensive mistakes.

What makes you scared off from Bisq? The application does take a little bit of time to learn but there is a good community to offer support.

Basically, if you want the ability to trade privately with no KYC requirements you will sacrifice some of the convenience that centralized exchanges offer. It is a trade-off worth doing in my opinion. 
hhsiaiq comment Give BISQ a try, it's a bit of a change in what u are used to, but not much more complex.

Start with something small, like 20-50 bucks. Been using it for years and it's my go-to place. Just fantastic platform. 
hhr3obq comment Use hodlhodl.com or bisq 
hhrkq3j comment Unfortunately your options aren't great. Mining and Bitcoin ATMs (with cash) are perhaps the most private, but come with a premium and aren't practical for earning / buying larger amounts.

I'd recommend against signing up with multiple exchanges. Although I get your logic of splitting up your purchases, it also increases your attack surface (i.e. only 1-of-N exchanges needs to be hacked for criminals to know you own Bitcoin). My advice would be to pick the most reputable exchange you can find and stick to it.

When registering for the exchange, use a dedicated email (preferably a privacy focused provider like Protonmail). Perhaps also a burner phone number and a fake / old address if they request it.

But it pays to be paranoid IMO. Good for you. 
hhq702m comment Mine your btc 
hhqx2r6 comment Siiiiigh! You do KYC when you make a bank account. You do KYC when you go to your dentist. You do KYC when you use a fiat exchange. Heck, you even do KYC when you buy a phone sim card. Ergo:
1) Why are you reluctant to give your KYC to an exchange that has more daily volume than most countries have money?
2) Over 95% of an exchange's funds are kept in cold storage. The 5% that are kept in a hotwallet can be stolen by hackers, but most exchanges will give your funds back in the event of a hack taking place.
3) Your realistic chances of getting your coins stolen by hackers are 1 in 2500. In comparison, a LOT more people lost their coins by shuffling them around too much, misplacing passwords or passphrases and so on. Some even say 1 in 6 bitcoins have been lost so far.
4) If your exchange offers stakeing with a cooldown for unstakeing your coins and you max all your security options, even in the unlikely event of an exchange or account hack happening, your hacker will have ZERO chances of stealing your coins.

hhq6l0g comment I would buy the dip 
hhq6mxe comment Lots of people would buy the dip really heavily. 
hhq6pim comment There would not be many bulls if it drops below 1k… 
hhq6ujq comment BTFD 
hhq75vs comment People answering they would buy the dip fail to realise that if bitcoin fell to 1k over night, the price would still reflect the convergence of buyers and sellers.

If bitcoin were to trade at 1k overnight, it would mean that no one is really buying the dip anymore. 

And for that to happen, it would mean that something gravely serious has happened. Maybe a software managed to crack a private key. I don't know. 

But if the BTC to 1k overnight were to happen, you'd better be sure you probably wouldn't be buying the dip. 
hhq6zid comment Look what happened yesterday.
Dropped to 8k in minutes.

qe2cs0 submission Does Blockstream's Satalite prevent forking? 
hhq9sp6 comment The satellites are nodes. They run a version of Bitcoin software of Blockstream's choice. Any block that don't follow the software's rules is deemed illegal and discarded. Subsequently, it can never see forks. There will be only one chain, the Bitcoin blockchain.

Some people run node software of forks on the same hardware. I doubt Blockstream's satellites are the case. As far as I know, Blockstream is Bitcoin-only.

Not sure what you mean by preventing forking. There is no way the satellites, or any nodes for that matter, can prevent the network from splitting if node runners disagree on the protocol. 
hhqo7vy comment They are meant to send a transaction from a place without internet or cellular. Just need a dish an SDR and some software. Not many places are dead zones like that. Almost no one is going to use these satellites. Blockstream going off planet to justify its valuation and spending all that vc money.

What else did they do? Created some side chain liquid? Almost nobody uses that. Bought and rebranded greenaddress wallet? Nobody needs multisig in mobile wallet. What else? Bought an asic manufacturer. Oh and releasing a hardware wallet. Haven't tried that yet. So yeah not the most exciting company 
hhr02i6 comment it helps. the same as every node does. 
hhr1k2n comment [deleted] 
hhsj1g5 comment I guess they must be thinking that if the network became broken up / segmented due to ?? whatever, natural disasters, nationwide power outages, solar activity, submarine cable failure then the ability to get tx/blocks from the sky acts as a kind of bridge keeping a chain consistent across the globe. I guess, maybe except not many people use this method, nor have the equipment on hand ready for such an event. So maybe it'll help in some small way. 
hhshq5z comment I don't think you can send via satellite unless that's changed now. I recall that you could only receive txs/blocks and maintain a node without internet connection. Have they now added sendings txs? That would be  a big change as they were using transmit only TV band data methods before. 
hhsic5g comment Can't be shut down is a stretch, given they must depend on a corporation and ground link for up bound data. Now granted they can beam data into areas that could otherwise block Bitcoin, eg. China, Iran or wherever. That has some value for resilience but if the USA decided to ban Bitcoin (not that I think they would) then I don't know how that wouldn't affect a satellite operated by a US corp. Blockstream doesn't own the satellite (they rent part of it's bandwidth), so even moving offshore isn't a fix. 
hhsmfde comment I didn't think of that. In that case, yes, they definitely help. Good point. 
hhsi70e comment Yes, it's the whole point. It's not meant for you to download blocks from. Can be too expensive. But you can send 500 byte transaction or whatever. I saw a 3 year old video. Honestly one would hope you can do MORE now than 3 years ago. I am not target audience so don't care. 
hhsjb3o comment Geez, that's the exact opposite of the info I recall seeing. The dish setup was SDR based and receive only. Oh well, as you say, not my focus either. Kinda shows how important it is to the average bitcoiner.
