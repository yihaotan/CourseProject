q9o5iz submission Drain 401k to buy into more btc? 
hgxd183 comment No it‚Äôs not worth, don‚Äôt pay a fee to put your savings in one bag, save money buy btc or use GBTC by talking to your retirement manager if tut can 
hgxgzqx comment Don‚Äôt touch your 401(k). Invest in BTC with incremental cash flow, over time, and hold. 
hgxdnmy comment You pay taxes on top of that 10% fee. If you can I would put it all in gbtc. If it were me and for some reason you can‚Äôt do that, I would take it out and put it in bitcoin but I‚Äôm a bad girl. 
hgxgi8m comment You said, ‚Äòbuy more into btc.‚Äô So assuming you have some of your funds already in it, I‚Äôd recommend to continue dca‚Äôn or however you‚Äôre accumulating sats. As far as draining 401k, I wouldn‚Äôt. Limit or stop contributions to it and use what your were to continue to buy into btc/crypto. Don‚Äôt downplay diversification in asset/investment planning. Keep the 401k. Keep funds that are in your Roth. 

If you want to go all in are crypto/btc, do it with current earned income. Always have an emergency savings account, so you don‚Äôt have to sell your btc in a bind (especially in bear market). Best of luck -my opinion - *not financial advice 
hgxdqrd comment Bro. Girl. Don‚Äôt do it. Invest in both long term ffs. 
hgxh7mz comment Not only is it a 10% penalty, but it‚Äôs also taxable income. If you can, look into taking about a loan against your 401k. Some employers have this benefit. 
hgxm01n comment GBTC for almost direct BTC exposure in your 401k.
Add in some miner stocks that also track BTC (MARA, CLSK, HUT)

This is going to provide nearly the return of direct BTC purchases without the withdrawal penalty and maintains the tax free advantage. 
hgxteu3 comment Don't do it. Besides for the fee that would take a portion of your investment, you want diversity in retirement investments. As the old saying goes don't put all your eggs in one basket. Keep investing in your company 401k, if they match a certain amount invest at least up to that amount, it's free money. Then keep investing in btc too. 
hgyq0fa comment Some diversification is good.

Don't liquidate your 401. Start putting other savings into btc.

hgxkhxo comment Bitcoin will be the most stable typically. Like coke or apple stocks. It won‚Äôt go up a crazy amount but won‚Äôt go down like shit coins will or companies on the brink of bankruptcy. But that doesn‚Äôt mean coke can‚Äôt tank, or Bitcoin can‚Äôt tank. It‚Äôs just more of a safer buy to not lose a ton of money and make money more conservatively, you might see a shitcoin go up 200% while Bitcoin goes up 2%. But the shitcoin will more than likely go down 50% or more while Bitcoin goes down 2-5 % just less Volatile if you can even say that about crypto. And I know people have made a ton of money in the past with Bitcoin but there‚Äôs only so high it can go once the world accepts it. Where lower market cap crypto has more room to grow. Diversity and do your own research and don‚Äôt fomo. Don‚Äôt panic sell. Buy and hold and chill

q9p36v submission Bitcoin ATM receipt issue 
q9p47m submission I made a post at the beginning of the year about how I‚Äôd be buying btc every week of the year. Here‚Äôs how it‚Äôs going! The blue circle was when btc first hit 60k, the green circle is now. The difference, is that my btc value has doubled since then, the power of stacking sats, stacking every day! 
hgymhzo comment DCA is Bitcoiner's best cheat code. Congrats! 
hgz3ngc comment What's your preferred day of the week for DCA? 
hgzkb09 comment If you bought all at once when you first purchased just imagine how much you would have. My point. Most people don't have it all the cash at once so they 'buy it as they get the cash to buy it'. Which is Great! I get a kick out of people however thinking that 'DCA' is a good investment strategy for BTC by holding back and investing periodically if they have the funds now to buy it all.  Very few times has that strategy paid off when it comes to the explosive upward nature of BTC. 
hgzmkdp comment [deleted] 
hgzi8to comment Did you put the same amount every week or did it vary? 
hgyvw83 comment DCA gives you Jetpack and all the keys! 
hgzc8u2 comment Monday 
hgzrsq8 comment Yeah definitely, if you could‚Äôve just dropped a lump sum in at 29k it would‚Äôve been smooth coasting all year, except for July when you went back to break even and slightly down, which would‚Äôve been scary to hold through. But I do agree with you that the earlier you can put into it the better, big moves in the coming years and I wouldn‚Äôt want to be late to the party! This was more of an experiment to see if it was profitable 
hgzqzyn comment Yeah that‚Äôs true, I think I could do it better by having charts and complaining so people would have an idea of how it performs in relation to other assets, comparing performance of different places you can park your capital

But for example, investing a set amount each month in spy up to October returned 7% compared to 26% in btc 
hgzrd5j comment Always the same base amount, but during the drop from 60k to sub 30 I put in extra since it was a better deal for me, so that probably accounted for the explosive move when it started coming back up. So it‚Äôs not an exact experiment but I‚Äôll try to figure out a better way to display info for future ones haha

we should also carefully use many different illegal means

It doesn't make sense to me to *only* abide by the arbitrary rules of the entity you're at war with. They don't abide by ours. 
hgxrjym comment You will own nothing and you will be happy. 
hgy67gg comment One good way to (lawfully) manipulate your taxes on Bitcoin is to hold your Bitcoin in a Self-directed IRA. Then you can buy/sell/trade with ultimate flexibility, and not incur taxes. (caveat: I can't remember how or if the wash sale rule fiasco applies inside of an IRA).

.

There are obviously trade-offs to doing this, because your money is tied up in a retirement account. But the net present value of tax deferral is very large. So it may be a good idea to do at least a part of your Bitcoin activity inside such an account. 
hgyniko comment I think us little people are far too docile when it comes to taxes, we just pay what's asked of us. Compare that to the richers, and they do everything in their means to pay as little as possible.

I'm not against taxes, as such, since they serve a purpose, but we are taxed on so many things. Income, property, food, fuel, roads; just to name a few. It's ridiculous, and I'm sick of it.

hgxxx1o comment >Bitfinex ‚Äúengaged in illegal, off-exchange retail commodity transactions in digital assets with U.S persons on the Bitfinex trading platform and operated as a futures commission merchant (FCM) without registering as required.‚Äù

So, anyone anywhere on the globe who even just occasionally trades with US persons automatically falls under US jurisdiction and can be fined by US government agencies.

Imagine Venezuela starts fining US-based Google millions of dollars for illegally offering Search services and operating as a Search merchant to Venezuela persons without registering as required in Venezuela?

Such attempts to grab global jurisdiction are unsustainable. These US agencies clearly believe that they are going to be able to enforce their national regulations globally.

It is time to start throwing stones at US regulatory agencies with global ambitions and call their bluff. What are they going to do? Send the Pentagon again? And then get smashed to smithereens by a local hill tribe? And then evacuate 120,000 of their local "translators"?

Seriously, why would anybody put up with that kind of arrogance? Seriously, in my opinion, there is only one effective cure for solving the mental disease of arrogance. 
hgxy4pl comment tldr; The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has ordered Tether Holdings and Bitfinex to pay $42.5 million in fines. Tether is accused of ‚Äúmaking untrue or misleading statements and omissions of material fact‚Äù in connection with the USDT stablecoin. The regulator also claims that BitFinex engaged in illegal, off-exchange retail commodity transactions in digital assets.

Internet natives have their own culture, memes, values, martyrs, unique history... and many netziens don't really feel like they belong to any one nation, and are often persecuted for their weird nerdy ideas.  

They even sort of have their own whacky religion ("simulation theory").  And, of course, their own currency.  

I'm pretty sure all that would qualify for international recognition of statehood, and many netziens would immediately seek 'asylum' from meatspace after they pass an internet citizenship test üòõ

In case of fomo other exchanges also offer business accounts and might verify them sooner. If they want to buy personal btc with personal money.. they can later legally transfer ownership of that btc to the corp entity.

hgxz7nk comment The bitcoin (dot) com domain is owned by a convicted felon who describes himself as "Bitcoin Jesus" and has a long history of unscrupulous behavior. From [vouching for MtGox solvency before it collapsed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/77vrek/roger_ver_on_mtgox_bitcoin_exchange_for_the/), to promoting Craig Wright [as if he were Satoshi Nakamoto](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/776fim/funny_how_all_the_criminals_and_fraudsters_in/), the owner acquired the "r / btc" subreddit and packed its mod team with paid employees to spread divisive misinformation about the bitcoin protocol and various individuals in the bitcoin space, including this subreddit as a whole. He has also leveraged the domain and subreddit to promote an impostor altcoin to unsuspecting newcomers as if it were actually Bitcoin. As such, the domain is considered malicious, and the r/Bitcoin mod team kindly asks that readers seek out credible sources to post instead.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Bitcoin) if you have any questions or concerns.* 
hgxzchw comment That is because Mark Cuban is a smart guy sometimes 
hgxzs8i comment Of course because that's the only way to actually own Bitcoin. 

The ETF's are for the people who don't trust Bitcoin but realize it actually has a number attached to it. 

It's currently around $61,000 right now. Time to gamble. 
hgxzcpp comment I don‚Äôt blame him. If you big into crypto easier to just buy on your own. 

If you want Bitcoin like a mutual fund for your portfolio, this would work 
hgy0xj1 comment A lot of US retirement savings are sitting in tax-sheltered accounts:

> What is the total value of all 401ks?

> The latest stats from the Investment Institute Company find total U.S. retirement assets were $28.3 trillion as of June, up 0.9 percent from March, and accounted for 32 percent of all household financial assets.

These funds usually incur a punitive tax penalty when prematurely withdrawn out of the system. So, if your money is trapped in one of these things, you may be interested in moving some of it into the ETF of your choice. It will still be trapped but at least it will allow you to choose your own devil.

> I can buy Bitcoin directly

Yes, that is undoubtedly true for you, Mark. 
hgy4lyw comment tldr; The owner of the NBA team Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban, has said he won't invest in bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The first bitcoin futures ETF could begin trading in the US as early as next week. Cuban has previously called bitcoin ‚Äúbetter gold than gold‚Äù due to its algorithmic scarcity.

hgy5t3x comment Smart, best to hold your own in your own wallet. 
hgyaw2t comment One positive about ETFs in countries which offer a TFSA (tax free savings account) is that you can literally max out your contributions to the TFSA in Bitcoin ETFs, wait 10-20 years, and you might have millions of dollars sitting in there which you can spend and never have to pay tax on it.

q9r3ra submission I am now pretty confident that the term "Millionaire" will be replaced by "Wholecoiners" in the near future 
hgy310h comment Wikipedia says the term millionaire was apparently "coined in French in 1719 to describe speculators in the Mississippi Bubble who earned millions of livres in weeks before the bubble burst."

Apparently 1 livre was equivalent to 1 pound of silver. A pound of silver is ~$375. So OG millionaire had the purchasing power of $375 million dollars. There is a huge difference in lifestyle of someone with $1 mill USD and someone with $375 mill USD. 
hgyl9kw comment Bitcoinare 
hgydb8i comment I'm pretty confident that you might be right and that you might be wrong. 
hgyjew8 comment I can see a scenario where "millionaire" stays.

When we have sats as the standard and that they are very valuable, being a sat millionaire (> 0.01 BTC) would be pretty impressive! 
hgy2csg comment It's odd really. I find myself saying, "I 'only' have 2 btc", and have to remind myself, not everyone can afford 1 btc. I just feel like I should own more seeing as how I bought my 1st btc in 2017 and say on it till this year. I should have been buying during the bear cycle 
hgz4gez comment Multicoiner ü§Ø 
hgyz7iq comment Wholecoiner is just someone with 100 million sats.

We will still use the term millionaire but people will be satoshi millionaires. If one sat equals one cent (one bitcoin = $1 million) a satoshi millionaire will be someone with the equivalent of $10,000. So the term millionaire will lose all luster.

However a satoshi billionaire will be someone with 1 billion sats which will be the equivalent of $10 million dollars if one btc = $1 million. Given that a million dollars today is nothing anymore, merely the value of a decent home it makes sense that $10 million should be the minimum to be considered wealthy.

So the new term for an ultra wealthy person will be billionaire in the context of anyone who has one billion satoshis, anyone with less than a billion satoshis is still rich and upper middle class but not wealthy.

One billion satoshis is 10 bitcoin.

The goal is to become a satoshi billionaire.

In other words:

Satoshi billionaire = the top 0.1%

Satoshi centimillionaire = the top 1%

Satoshi decamillionaire = middle class.

Less than a million sats = struggle town.

hgzulxa comment Things you can say to friends and family that don't understand Bitcoin to help them along:

- We're moving into a digital society, and Bitcoin shares several characteristics of gold, but is digital (i.e. better).

- You can use it just like a savings account. It is much more volatile, but is up-only in the long-term.

- Governments print as much money as they want, devaluing the current supply. Bitcoin has a set number (21 million) that will ever exist. Simple supply and demand. Fix the money, fix the world.

- Wealthy people, corporations, and countries are buying, which has erased any stigma people may associate with it.

Feel free to add. 
hgys3to comment How many (like me) start as simple opportunists trying to cash in some money, but then, once they dig into subject are like ‚ÄúI will never sell‚Äù and fk governments and their money and printing and inflation, let‚Äôs dismantle this whole circus and Satoshi is a new messiah? 
hgybslq comment Are you all aware of the fact that we are the 8th biggest asset of the world in terms of market capitalisation? Just below Silver and above Facebook.

We are living revolutionary times. Friends. Only approx. 10x from here to take over gold and we will be the biggest asset known to human kind.

q9sdfu submission Mark Cuban Talks Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin In a Twitter Space Call 
q9sf1o submission What‚Äôs the end game? 
hgyc4fz comment Getting to the moon, obviously. 
hgydk85 comment I imagine regulation will come in and kill all the BS like cumrocket and whatnot, all securities will move to using blockchains, and the crypto market will essentially become the mainstream stock market 
hgygmxf comment Best case scenario: 

BTC takes the place of gold as a tool for storing your wealth, hedge against inflation, etc

Realistic scenario:

BTC approaches taking over gold. Some nations adopt it as legal tender. At that point big international players enter hard and start manipulating it in order to affect others. One of the previous comments speaks about how BTC can become the international reserve currency and probably the international currency for stuff like oil trades, etc. that‚Äôs a nice dream. But there‚Äôs a reason oil keeps trading in USD and it‚Äôs that the US guards that standard with carriers. Controlling the defacto international currency is a great power. And it won‚Äôt be let unchecked. Big players will always try to control it. People will say ‚Äúbut BTC is decentralized - noone can control it‚Äù. But if you hold enough of it, you can control the price. And I bet there‚Äôs at least 2 states out there already owning massive amounts of BTC. So I‚Äôd say we‚Äôre headed at
1. Approaching gold
2. Legal tender adoption 
3. Brutal sell out 
4. International jurisdiction in order to ‚Äúsave us from that big bad risk‚Äù
5. Settings up as a more risky ‚Äúgold alternative‚Äù and nothing more. 
hgygnre comment the end game is the beginning and middle game. intentions are individual. bitcoin could bring down governments. will it? depends if people want that. depends if people act with courage. censorship resistance is a pretty good end game in itself. 
hgycusa comment I think the end game is to replace the US Dollar as the global currency, because this is how I see it. First bitcoin will get experimented with major countries like how we are seeing today, and then like what had happened with El Salvador, smaller countries seeing the success and the potential for success from people in major countries experimenting with bitcoin will begin to adopt it as legal tender. And then finally major countries seeing the domino effect will begin to accept it as legal tender, replacing the need for the US dollar for Bitcoin instead. Its actually reminiscent of how the US Dollar itself became the world currency. First countries that traded with the US began accepting it for trading purposes, then due to its hegemony on the international marketplace local currencies became devalued, and now in almost every country you need to have a large sum of US dollars in order to make a large scale transaction. It in a sense will become a lot like Central America. Where everyone uses USDs to buy a house but uses pesos to buy a bicycle. In time the same will happen to the US dollar where everyone in America or the world for that matter will use Bitcoin to buy a house and local currencies like USD to buy a thing of groceries. 
hgyi8ha comment I think it will mostly we a store of wealth replacing gold. Actually it would not replace gold but both will co exist. Just a speculation! 
hgyyc4t comment Gold has zero counter party risk.   When you hold gold the cost is already built in.  The us didn‚Äôt ban crypto because big money can regulate it and profit. 
hh03div comment So we can all get rich! We can buy it now and hold it until it becomes really valuable so we can sell it and have lots of money.

/sarcasm. Vote me down. 
hgyzozs comment It‚Äôs sort of like the 51 percent attack scenario. Big countries see it as an opportunity to gain more easily by building more so than to destroy.  It just has to get bigger to support the world economy. We need to have patience and it will work out just like the internet network effect. I get the skepticism, but the incentive structure and ease of monetary gain by supporting rather than destroying is in Bitcoins favor now and always will be. It‚Äôs a brilliant design that keeps going due to greed being part of human nature. 
hgyftyg comment Try this scenario out

China pushes hard to move nations involved in One Belt One Road onto their digital RMB.

The US pushes to get western nations onto or atleast involved with the digital USD (I believe it could co-exist with a digital Euro, and even digital CAD or AUS if nations prefer financial sovereignty at the cost of continued friction)

Nations not from either of those blocks -
Western Africa, most of Latin America, Russia, Turkey, India. Perhaps even Japan and South Korea someday.

These nations seek a third path and rather than cede sovereignty to China or the US they back their currencies with BTC.

It becomes the fairest available option for nations that lack the ability to compete for currency control with the big CBDCs.

hgyl7c4 comment I agree. But it's like this with any project.

I think people other than yourself want to have those conversations, but it's a pretty small crowd.

hgym64a comment Like gold had an iPhone moment? 
hgym3d3 comment tldr; The most important innovation that the iPhone brought ‚Äî which the crypto space needs to gain mass adoption ‚Äî is the user experience. The most significant reason why people get into crypto now is price gains, not its value. Positioning crypto as an amazing tool for financial freedom and decentralization will ring hollow to most people. The average person does not care about crypto itself, they care about what it gives them.

hgyzh9t comment Waiting for the iPhone to have a Bitcoin moment. 
hh02hwt comment If Bitcoin could only do to Apple/iPhone Google/Android what it's doing to fiat! 
hgymgux comment More like iPhone had a gold moment.. Lol 
hgyo8do comment Exactly this.

And this also a reason why I would be carefoul about betting everything on Bitcoin. Because the mass adoption will happen when someone brings something easy and simple to use. And it may be other coin.

It may not be so secure, it may not even be based on blockchain and use "crypto" only as a buzz word. But mainstream users dont care about this (unfortunatelly). If the crypto will become future fiat replacement/alternative, the winner that will take over crypto market, wont be the first one on the market. It wont be the most secure one. It will be the one that grandpa can use to get his pension and pay his bills and groceries with.

So personally I believe in crypto future. But Im not so sure if the Bitcoin will take over the word or end up as a Nokia (once leader of the market, and only thing everybody wanted...)

hgyn7sy comment tldr; Crypto analyst Alessio Rastani believes Bitcoin is entering the final stage of the current bull market, which will propel the leading cryptocurrency to a $100,000 price target in the next few months. He cited the Elliott Wave Theory, which divides upward price trends into five waves. "When this five-wave move completes, then I‚Äôm expecting a bear market," he said.

*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.* 
hgyw89c comment üòÇ He‚Äôs gonna need to redefine his stance every week if his only TA in speculating price movement is only Elliot Waves. They can be effective but they are very inaccurate for long term determination in the waves for highly liquid and volatile assets. Pretty sure crypto as a traded asset satisfies the criteria. Can‚Äôt wait to see this 100k EOY prediction not come to fruition. Oh, wait ‚Äúfew months‚Äù can be in two, twenty, or even more. Glad he kept it vague to save face and still ‚Äúclaim‚Äù he wasn‚Äôt technically wrong.

hgyszwy comment > why doesn't everyone mine it instead of buying it?  

Because it requires:  
- upfront costs which you make up for only after x weeks/months/years  
- loud hardware that gets hot  
- some technical understanding  
- somewhat cheap electricity  
- has some uncertainty built into it (your profitability depends not only on your own circumstances, but also on other miners as well as on the price fluctuations)  

On the other hand, if you have somewhat cheap electricity and/or access to cheap hardware (ASICs) and/or the desire for non-KYC (private) coins, mining might be for you.

Reddit will say that the profile doesn't exist. If that's the case, you'll need to contact the Reddit admins and ask them to unban you. Basically, what the message in the screenshot says :) 
hgyus51 comment Obligatory "the other account isn't mine" but it isn't banned and this was obv an attempt from your mods to troll that user.
 
These practices are common here, and any criticism gets deleted. Check yourselves. 
hgyuuv7 comment Well, have you tried to do what I suggested with your other account? 
hgyv0t8 comment It isn't banned. Stop trolling. It will bite you back. 
hgyv3of comment I'm trying to help you -.- 
hgyvsds comment It is not shadow banned. If you wanted to help you'd check your mods. 
hgyvuqw comment Which account is that? It's possible that it's not shadowbanned anymore, because the Reddit admins usually un-shadowban them on request, if it was a mistake by their automated spam filters.

hgzzly5 comment The case in El Salvador with remittances comes to mind since the fees that normally go to western union can be spent locally on goods and services.

But generally you‚Äôre right i agree.

q9vwp6 submission How do Crypto banks like Vauld make money when they give us interest on FD deposits? 
hgz6y7s comment I would ***never*** lend any bitcoins.  The risk far exceeds the relatively tiny rewards. 
hgyz40l comment Yes, they lend your BTC etc 

Crypto banks are still a newish thing, so while they currently pay higher interest, it doesn't necessarily mean they charge more interest, they just take a smaller cut for themselves.

Once they become mainstream they will become greedier and pay less. 
hgz3yfk comment I don't understand the push for plebs to lend out their BTC....if you buy and HODL(cold storage) you have historical asset growth of over 100%(doubling) that has occured for the last 10yrs.....instead you loan out your BTC for a paltry 6% with no control or even recourse if neither the principal or interest is paid....in money terms I have 100$ on Jan1, I put it in my personal safe and on Dec31 I have 200$(or more)....vs...I give some shady guy who's name I don't know a 100$, we agree to meet on a dark Street corner in a year and he promises to give me 206$.. .get out of here

hh16niz comment Yes, it's known as a custodial service. There is always a risk if you do not solely own the private keys to your holding. If you have it in a crypto bank (or exchange), they hold the private keys.

Some people enjoy earning the interest, and others would say it's crazy to hold your coins in any custodial service.

hgzdcp7 comment tldr; As of mid-2021, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, Coinbase, had 68 million verified users. As many as 21% of U.S. hedge funds now own bitcoin in some form, according to surveys. Ben Bernanke once noted that the US government has a technology, called a printing press, that allows it to produce as many US dollars as it wishes at essentially no cost.

hgzpmr8 comment >Not a single reviewer has pointed to any lack of the 21 Million cap in the code. If you cannot trust your own IT experts, you should step back as CEO due to loss of authority.

Yes it's quite the opposite.

>When prominent security researcher Dan Kaminsky first reviewed Satoshi‚Äôs code he tried to pentest it with 9 different exploits, but was amazed to find that Satoshi had already anticipated and patched out all of them.

hgzph3g comment Apparently he started trashtalking bitcoin the same week his bank started buying it. He caused a dip to buy. It's by design bro. He's a snake. (I have not verified this but I did see a thing on it and it smells like reptile)

hgzbv2m comment Why everyone try and bring up Trump still lol. Literally irrelevant to this conversation 
hgz2gtm comment can the cap be changed with consensus? 
hgzajf2 comment It's kinda funny because in his mind he THINKS the BTC cap supply can be changed on a whim.   So that's obviously a weakness.  

So good thing the dollar doesn't work that way?!?

hgzeszd comment I haven't tried it myself, but I think that if you have a full node, Electrum server and Electrum client on the same system you can temporarily take it offline to sweep the private key, spend from it and bring it online again. I have a full node and Electrum server on my laptop and when I'm offline, the Electrum client still think it's online (the Electrum client only connects to localhost).
