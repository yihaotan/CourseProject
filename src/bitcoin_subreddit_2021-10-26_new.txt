hi2jk4f comment In the rule setting, the output of Bitcoin will be halved every four years from the initial 50. In other words, when Bitcoin was first issued, the mining reward was 50 Bitcoins. In 2012, Bitcoin production was halved to 25 Bitcoins. In 2016, Bitcoin was halved again to 12.5 Bitcoins. On May 11, 2020, the third halving to 6.25 bitcoins, and so on, until the last bitcoin is mined. The calculation is as follows:  
  
1. The number of blocks generated every four-year cycle: 6 blocks per hour\*24 hours a day\*365 days a year\*4 years per cycle=210,240\~=210,000.  
  
2. Block reward size: 50 + 25 + 12.5 + 6.25 + 3.125 +…= 100;  
  
3. Multiply the two together: 210,000 \* 100 = 21 million.  
  
This is how the total number of bitcoins is 21 million. According to this method, around 2140, the last Bitcoin will be mined. At present, the number of bitcoins that have been mined is close to 19 million, and there are only more than 2 million unmined.  
  
Add one point: The total circulation of Bitcoin cannot reach 21 million. First, the last bitcoin will take a long time to develop, and it will not even be dug out for hundreds of years; second, the bitcoin is on the account address, and the user needs to remember the private key to transfer the bitcoin. As many users privately lose their keys and many addresses can no longer retrieve the bitcoins, the number of bitcoins in circulation on the market will be far less than 21 million. 
hi1zsfa comment Pretty easy to just google it or look at the other 21 million posts about it on reddit... 
hi27pkf comment Software. 
hi2cf99 comment It's there in the source code.

Since it's open source, anyone can see it.

And you can even run your own bitcoin node. 
hi27t1b comment THIS^YES_THIS 
hi2fo99 comment Not a totally wrong answer, but I think it's the answer that leads to more skepticism because code isn't immutable. While the linked code is an implementation that follows the Bitcoin rules, it is really the protocol specification that and ties the network together and provides governance.

So I think a slightly better answer is: supply policy is embedded into the protocol. 

In other words, if a Bitcoin node implementation was modified to alter supply policy, it would by definition create a new network. That new network may even gain popularity, but it will not be Bitcoin anymore.

hi24c32 comment The decentralized comes when you take the money and put it in your wallet . Then no one can control it but you... 
hi23eh3 comment The company holds the keys to your wallet.  You do have 5000 in BTC but Coinbase or whomever controls the access to those keys, not you.  Ideally you would then transfer that BTC to a decentralized wallet that only you have access to. 
hi28sna comment Bitcoin is independent of any bank, exchange, government, country, etc.

The Bitcoin network is all around the world, powered by users that choose to run their own node (this means just running an application on a laptop for example, anyone can do it).

You can get Bitcoins deposited into your own wallet (which you can download for free in your own device) in exchange of your goods and services. You don't need any bank, or exchange to do this.

In the same way, you can pay for goods and services directly from your wallet to someone else's wallet without any bank, exchange, or any other intermediary.

Now, an exchange offers the service of converting Bitcoin to fiat, and viceversa. This means that you will need a bank or financial institution for the fiat part. And they offer the service of storing your Bitcoins in their wallet until you withdraw them to your own wallet. As long as you keep the Bitcoins in that exchange it's similar to just having a bank with fiat, you're right. That's why you should withdraw it to your own wallet.

Here's some reading material:

hi24ozd comment Once you have gained a few assets to exchange, you can switch to using a decentralized exchange. You only need these kinds of centralized services for fiat>crypto. Once you have crypto you can keep it all off of centralized exchanges from then on. 
hi2bldd comment You are on the right track. Once you buy your Bitcoin, move it to a wallet where you control the private keys. At this point, it is decentralized. Easy peasy. 
hi27n8o comment Tell us, please, about the "technology behind it".  Please be specific. 
hi22vtu comment of course the fiat sitting there is not a good thing. the same goes for btc sitting there. you are not necessarily buying from the exchange, but from other users of the exchange. to facilitate the deal this needs a central element. but there are decentralized options available. 
hi23u1m comment Think of an exchange as a market place you bought $5,000 in Btc some sold $5,000. The exchange pocket the transaction fees you walk out with your Btc someone walks out with the USD. 
hi2hq4i comment For example: you bought BTC from coinbase using legal currency, at this stage you are still in a centralized financial system, but you are decentralized when you transfer from coinbase to coinbase wallet.  
The coinbase wallet is a Defi product. Only when your currency is transferred to a trusted DeFi product you are decentralized, and of course there are hardware wallets. 
hi2npic comment Exchanges are a shop. They have nothing to do with bitcoin or its network. Once you pay the shop you move the  bitcoin to your own self custodied wallet. Otherwise you're just leaving it in the shop for some stupid reason.

qfve9i submission Does Bitcoin Have Intrinsic Value? 
hi27heo comment The whole ***idea*** of money is to use something with *little or no intrinsic value* as a general public, general purpose IOU so that we don't have to resort to using barter. 
hi29sq8 comment Bitcoin has incredible utility and scarcity 
hi311in comment Instead of asking, "what gives Bitcoin its value?"

I prefer to ask, "what would make Bitcoin lose its value?"

---

Bitcoin would be worthless if the ledger weren't **balanced**. What use would anyone have for a ledger in which the numbers didn't add up? It would be a confusing tangle of lies and falsehoods.

Bitcoin would be worthless if the ledger weren't **trustworthy**. What use would anyone have for a ledger in which the balances were all wrong?

Bitcoin would be worthless if the ledger weren't **secure**. What use would anyone have for a ledger in which the balances could be manipulated by bad actors?

Bitcoin would be worthless if the ledger weren't **immune to hyper-inflation**. What use would anyone have for a ledger in which account balances rapidly lost value, even as the numbers stayed the same?

Bitcoin would be worthless if the ledger weren't **decentralized**. What use would anyone have for a ledger which could easily be destroyed or manipulated by outside forces?

Bitcoin would be worthless if the ledger weren't **long-lasting**. What use would anyone have for a ledger that is here today and gone tomorrow?

Bitcoin would be worthless if the ledger weren't **widely-accepted**. What use would anyone have for a ledger that no one uses except themselves?

Etc, etc. I'm sure I could come up with a dozen more.

---

If you want to know why Bitcoin has value, just turn these on their head:

Bitcoin has value because its ledger is **balanced**, **trustworthy**, **secure**, **immune to hyper-inflation**, **decentralized**, **long-lasting**, **widely-accepted**, and so forth. 
hi29tb0 comment tl:dr You shouldn't read it either trust me it's a waste of your time.. 
hi28zs5 comment so you're just making up a long and complicated definition of "intrinsic value", then testing it against bitcoin? it's so arbitrary.  

value is ultimately subjective. so intrinsic value is just a fiat construction. irrelevant to bitcoin. bitcoin has value as evidenced by its robust and active marketplace. that's all it needs. 
hi3mgez comment The only intrinsic value exists in land and human food & water reserves. But having unlimited supply of only one food is not valuable unless it is combined with something else, because no food exists that provides everything a human needs to survive. 
hi4bvs1 comment I agree with a lot of the comments here that just asking the *value* of bitcoin is perhaps the more important question than asking about *intrinsic* value. However, I have two thoughts on this:

1. It is an interesting mental exercise (at least for me) to go through some of this analysis. And perhaps useful to have thought through some of it when encountering the "but no intrinsic value" argument from btc skeptics.

2. I think you could validly argue that a practical definition of intrinsic value is essentially utility. If so, that means that half of the equation for value depends on what utility btc has. This post was intended to be an exploration of that utility within that framework. 
hi7uqnv comment Bitcoin has achieved meta because really an ‘imaginary’ but completely objective measure, subject to none, and to all is the next evolution of money 
hi7ulvg comment Something with little or no intrinsic value with intrinsic value backing, if you’re using the bank method. Bitcoin impressively manages to be both at once somehow. 
hi8qy8r comment Bitcoin has all the properties required of "strong" money: portable, divisible, fungible, recognizable, durable, ***scarce***, difficult/expensive to create.  

This makes it a good "general public, general purpose IOU," and THAT is what gives it value: you can use it as a store of value and medium of exchange because it has those properties.

hi2cp1n comment Not sure what you want to hear.

All these platforms are similar. They all have similar risks.

If you're OK with that, go ahead.

Always remember though, if the coins are not in your own wallet, you haven't really earned any interest yet. 
hi2g73k comment In fact, I think this is a scam, don't you think it is similar to a certain degree of centralized finance? 
hi2ktiy comment How are they generating 17% on Bitcoin? Seriously ask yourself this question. Why is the competition all fairly close to one another in terms of return, yet this one is much higher than all of them? If it’s too good to be true it probably is… Not to mention the fact that “not your keys not your coin”. 
hi2pggf comment Fk that. Anything with Midas in name is MLM. Buy your coins and hold them in a private wallet. 
hi31bo0 comment Sounds way to much. 25% is not sustainable and sounds like a scam. Stay with the big platforms for the least amount of risk

qfwar9 submission Meme for the day 
hi54r67 comment The government wants half of all the upside reward with none of the downside risk. 

The more you pay the more they find ways of wasting tax payer money and then telling you they don't have enough tax revenue.

Look at government like a service provided, any government that takes more than 10% sales tax, 30% income tax and any capital gains tax at all is a suffocating oppressive regime that wastes more than it provides.

All bitcoiners should leave their high taxed countries and move to jurisdictions where crypto is either specifically not taxed or it is not taxed by default because there is no capital gains tax. 
hi4u0ut comment This is how it is with everything that INDIVIDUALS invest in. You invest in GME, it reaches the moon, guess what? Tax Collectors gonna collect. Pull the pants down on corrupt government officials' investments, guess what? You're going to get investigated.  

Now, when Bankers and their stocks go BRRRRR, all of a sudden, it's "bailout the banks" because "they're too big to fail". 

But also note, in MOST countries, you only pay tax on gains you realize.  If you invest in GME at $69420/share, and it reaches $696969/share, and you cash in, you pay tax on your profits.  However, if you're waiting for it to hit $1M/share, then you don't pay tax.  

Way to go me, for over-analyzing the joke. 
hi63m5g comment I suppose your government doesn't recognize capital losses, hmm? 
hi50y2o comment But if banks or stocks or whatever go BRRRR, they’re going up in price, so there is no need for a bailout. I believe you’re confusing BRRRRR with Bust, which would mean a drop in value and need to save the ancillary products holding up the rest of the systems used for paying entitlements, think pensions.

Go me for over analyzing one word in one part of your comment. 

Good rebuttal though. Buy yourself some sats for the effort, you’ve earned them. 
hi7anef comment Hey, but at least you get a 3,000$ a year tax deduction in case of a loss, the government is so generous. 

And as far as I remember from when I lived in the US, that yearly 3,000$ has never been raised since 
hi515qm comment I always interpreted BRRR as "going from hot to freezing". 
hi7ca6o comment 2 reasons why that isn't a big deal:
1) because wealthy people abuse the shit out of such loopholes.  
2) Investments are a risk, they're not meant to be a tax-deduction. If you lose more than $3K, and that's a big deal to you, then you shouldn't have invested that much. 

But I understand why that, to you, doesn't seem fair and reasonable, though.  Especially when you consider that wealthy people already have enough legal tax-avoidance tools at their disposal. 
hi51fuo comment It’s commonly received as going from “off to printing” in Bitcoin to stock land.

Hence “Money printer go BRRRRRRR”

hi2isv5 comment 1 mil by 2030. That’s all I really care about 
hi2h27j comment tldr; Analyst Plan B estimates that the price of Bitcoin (BTC) will rise to $98,000 during the month of November and will exceed $130,000 before the end of 2021. The researcher is based on the Stock To Flow model (S2F) to predict the value that the cryptocurrency will have in the months to come. The launch of bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US is positively influencing the price.

qfwrb2 submission Bitcoin Is Still Concentrated in a Few Hands, Study Finds 
hi2hsf2 comment You mean it’s already more distributed than the worlds fiat…! Wow. 
hi2ibjx comment Wealth inequality? What a bitcoin specific issue! Tell me more 
hi2hy3y comment Same as it ever was. 

At least those who control large amounts of bit recognize what it is and voluntarily purchased it and/or mined it. 

Fiat is more concentrated among top holders and that distribution is between a good old boys network of detached upper-crust demons. 

Fuck this FUD. 
hi2gwj4 comment 1/3 control, per the article. MINE AND HODL 
hi2k6dp comment STudY fINds 
hi2ksoe comment I'll say it...

***NO SHIT???***

Just like all other forms of wealth?  Who would have guessed it?

Let's be honest with ourselves.  The wealthy will always have control of the most wealth. It doesn't matter which system you use.  Creating "our money" to "fight the man" doesn't stop this from happening.

Once the wealthy take a new form of wealth seriously, they will eventually control it. Why? Because they have the wealth to do so.

No centralized bank?  No government control?  That make it even easier.

Your kids will be bitching about Crypto the way people bitch about fiat.  And don't go blaming the wealthy for hoarding the wealth.  The entire reason we all are buying Crypto is so that we can be wealthy as well.  If this wasn't true no one would care about the price going up and Hodling. 
hi2opjg comment Wealth is concentrated. Get over it.  You know what else is concentrated? Talent, quality, truth, intelligence, innovation, beauty, efficiency and productivity.  If you want wealth, try earning it instead of whining like a bitch because you don't have it like that guy you saw drive by in a lambo. It's a big world, and it's full of lazy idiots mostly.  But Time Magazine and corporate media in general isn't brave enough to run that story. So they shouldn't be running any stories that involve truth or facts or anything that matters. These are not human values on display in corporate media. It's a mob which has formed and needs to be quelled, just like the biggest and most powerful mob, govt itself. And they have the nerve to speak about "concentration" of power in the form of wealth. Look in the mirror much? Collectivism is concentration of power. No collectivist gets to preach about concentration of power (the wealth kind, or the political kind) without being completely hypocritical and ethically inconsistent. 
hi2h1xo comment tldr; The top 10,000 individual investors in Bitcoin control about one-third of the cryptocurrency in circulation, according to a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research. Such a high concentration could make the Bitcoin network vulnerable to a 51% attack, where a colluding set of miners or one miner takes control of a majority of the network.

qfwyl9 submission Whats the best wallet for receiving Bitcoin with minimal fees? 
hi2i2si comment You only pay to send, not receive. 
hi2jkye comment Electrum is pretty good. 
hi2r98q comment all non custodial wallets are the best because fees are whatever you want to pay (for sending). you don't pay for receiving. 
hi2it8y comment I’d say Coinbase just because I believe they’re the best. Not as far as fees but just as far as security, reliability, and the user friendly ability. Any wallet you send to should have the same transfer fee if I’m not mistaken. Once your transfer you can keep it in Coinbase or if your transfer it out of Coinbase, once it touches your bank account you will get taxed. So either keep it in Coinbase as BTC or USD till you need it to spend with. Unless you just want it all in your bank up to you, no harm in that.

Even if you keep it in Bitcoin that’s totally fine as I’m bullish with large investments in BTC. IMO I think it would be difficult to lose a significant amount keeping it in BTC. 
hi2lhyb comment This!
For sender, make sure you use a native segwit address for the lowest possible fee. 
hi2jbau comment Coinbase will probably ban your account if you send or receive coins directly to/from a gambling site

there's countless similar ones these days and clearly it's too technical for most people so they make easy prey. still to keep something in mind. there's no such thing as self-custodial centralized premine scam since ownership of coins can easily be edited away from you which we already seen done in the past on their centralized blockchain.

He said even if half of them were legit then the world is about to see a big shift soon, with more countries embracing Bitcoin as legal tender or store of value.

Of course, he could just have been pumping me up to buy more miners, and people could be BSing him as well, so take it with a grain of salt, but part of me thinks it's not that farfetched. We already have people in Congress talking about mining Bitcoin to stabilize the electric grid in the US.

hi2wbaw comment > edit is it better to use Bitcoin investing for long term goals (paying off a house) than short term goals (saving for a car)?

Yes. The longer you wait, the better the returns.

[Have a look here](https://hodl.camp/)

You'll see that no one in the entire history of Bitcoin has lost purchasing power if they waited at least 3 years, 4 months, and 4 days (and that's the worst case) 
hi2u2y1 comment Allow me to demonstrate how easily you can accomplish this. The most recent post I made shows the last 120 days of just buying $6.27 of bitcoin every day in detail. What it's shown me was a huge eye opener to how quickly money can grow and how well DCA works (dollar cost averaging). Take a peek, it'll open your eyes and give you some hope. 
hi2thfm comment Keep hustling. You're young.  You'll get there. Just do what you can 
hi2xwe9 comment I can't make your financial decisions for you but I'd recommend setting aside a fixed amount from each paycheck into a saving account designated specifically for getting yourself an inexpensive but reliable used car, title and registration, and six months of auto insurance that you can pay up front. Getting that first car will get you back-and-forth to work safely, efficiently, conveniently,  and make you more marketable to employers (current and future) looking for a reliable employee who can and will show up on time. That doesn't mean you can't invest a little each paycheck into Bitcoin but you'll want to have cash that is liquid for gas, eats, dates, rent, etc. 
hi32248 comment As a newcomer you want to invest into something with as low risk as possible first and foremost. No matter how small potential profit is, you have to invest the biggest part in BTC just to get going with this market in general. 
hi3357w comment The problem this subreddit has, is presenting Bitcoin like it’s something that’s going to make everyone rich. Which isn’t the ethos of Bitcoin. 

I have been buying through all time highs, and I’m a marginal buyer, who lives a fully functional life in my 30’s. So I need fiat money coming out of my bank constantly. I just chuck what I can into Bitcoin. I have a modest amount, and that’s good for me. 
hi2wkqb comment I have more BTC than most hindsight is 20/20 friend, I wish I had your mentality at 19 years of age I’m only ten years or so older at this point. It’s the mentality and what you will learn throughout the process. There’s nothing you can’t do if you focus start DCA’ing. Someone else said and I’ll be honest I don’t hold ALT coins. However learning to trade with them is a great investment no pun intended. Only buy projects you have researched and store your value in BTC. I’ve been messing around shorting SHIB and made a couple of hundred pretty easily. 

Learn some technical analysis and enjoy the blessing that you have this revelation at 19 when most people are are throwing away potential. Lastly whatever you do don’t try to short Bitcoin specifically just buy it and hold it. You’ve got this you’re early in many ways.

qfz1b1 submission Op-Ed: The First Bitcoin ETF Is Already in Danger. Here’s Why 
hi39dwb comment “The end result is the ETF will start taking on potentially significant tracking error versus the spot price of Bitcoin. The ETF is forced to obtain Bitcoin price exposure at higher and higher prices as it goes further out on the futures curve.”

Which will probably lead to extended hedging via buying spot bitcoin and raising the price through demand. 
hi2xlme comment tldr; The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF is approaching its limit on futures contracts holdings, as enforced by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). Last week, data from Bloomberg indicated that ProShares’ Bitcoin ETF was holding 1900 futures contracts dated for October. This was only 100 short of the 2000 futures contract limit imposed by the CME during an ETF’s first month.

*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.* 
hi43o2l comment Glad to know I'm not crazy for thinking these futures ETFs would not be able to track the spot price of bitcoin. They're going to be stuck in a cycle of purchasing futures at a premium to spot, then selling those futures at a price near spot (when the futures are about to mature), then rebuying longer-dated futures again at a premium. So the ETFs are going to continually bleed money to premiums.

hi4sa7z comment Honest question

Does anyone else always feel fomo even though they’re buying constantly?  I’ve been DCA-ing for quite a while and I still sell things on eBay or find little ways to get some extra money because I feel the need to constantly add to my stack.

Almost like it’s become an addiction.  I’m married so I can’t 100% into btc but I sold all of my stocks and bought btc and mining stocks.  Nothing else.  

I have a retirement. I have fiat savings.  If btc went to 0 I’d be fine. But I’ve bought 5 times in one week. I’ve bought $3000 and I’ve bought $6 btc. 

I’m just ranting I guess. But does anyone else get an unreasonable feeling that you’re going to miss out on something if you’re not loading up all the time?

hi2xlfg comment tldr; Mastercard is planning to integrate Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into its payments and banking platforms. The integration means that digital wallets could be filled with cryptocurrency instead of cash, and existing airline and hotel points could be converted to Bitcoin. The move comes at a time when digital transactions using Bitcoin are booming, despite a limited number of businesses accepting the cryptocurrency.

qfzaah submission Pssst... Every power company will eventually be mining Bitcoin 
hi3256v comment I’m an ex-nuclear physicist who used to work in the field of nuclear data that was used for modeling nuclear reactors, so not directly but was close to the world of nuclear power. 

I find the idea of mining bitcoin with nuclear power bigger than the recent hype over renewables.

Nuclear was always limited to the base load (which is quite low compared to peak load), due to very long lag to scaling up and down power output for nuclear. So basically nuclear was limited to base load and other power sources which could ramp up and down faster filled the gap between base load and peak demand. Nuclear is by far the most energy efficient fuel by density and among the cleanest of fuels when consider all environmental impacts, but was always limited to this base load. France could get around this and get to >80% nuclear by selling power to neighbors, but this was really  geo hack and said more about their neighbors energy sources rather than some way everyone could be majority nuclear.

Back then some 15 years ago there was some push (well I attended a few talks at LLNL where I worked) for using hydrogen fuel cells (which was competing at the time with EVs for car power), as a way to store the excess energy produced by nuclear so it could take a bigger fraction of power consumption above base load. The excess could be used to produce hydrogen fuel cells which essentially store the energy to be used later in vehicles. This idea fell through when EVs won out over hydrogen as the next-gen car fuel.

Bitcoin mining is bringing this idea back and could lead to a resurgence in new nuclear power (which is the only real solution to clean up our energy grid) and make it more stable. I hope this leads to increased nuclear power usage and incentives to build modern style nuclear reactors which are orders of magnitude safer than the old reactors which give nuclear a bad image and should have been retired decades ago.

hi3vaxg comment Welcome to our NEW SUN. Some of us have known this since before 2015, yet Saylor is the one getting all the credit. Damned genius. 
hi2xks4 comment Them: "Why should we be selling you this power when it could be buying us BTC?" 
hi3zedu comment I think it's more accurate to say that every power company will be able to call on bitcoin mining when grid demand is too low. Whether they own the mining hardware or just contract with a group that does will depend on the power company's risk tolerance.

Do they want to risk buying all that mining hardware that will sit idle more than half the day or do they let someone else take that risk and just share profits a small percent of the time. 
hi4cy9j comment if you take this a step further, every power company will then consider whether they can make more selling their power to a customer or by mining bitcoin with it. From the perspective of energy consumers, that is not good because it will drive the price of power up, especially in places that currently have cheap power.

Imagine a big, but remote hydropower plant that currently provides cheap electricity to local customers. Big customers, say a large aluminium factory or greenhouses may even have movde close to benefit from the cheap energy. In the coming bitcoin era, instead, the hydropower plant needs only an internet connection to be able to compete in bitcoin mining with power plants all over the world, and they can make a lot more money from their cheap power that way. As a result, the aluminium factory and the greenhouse get no cheap power anymore. They'll have to pay the premium price they pay anywhere else. 
hi38fbn comment true, but please don't say that bitcoin is a store of energy.

a battery is a store of energy.

a gas tank is a store of energy.

a bitcoin is a monetary asset, with which you can buy energy when needed. (provided someone else produces it!)

hi37ncb comment tldr; In October 2021, Howard University students are being forced to sleep outside in tents as well as being hospitalized because of the mold in the dorms. The students were also being harassed by police officers and being told to get out of certain buildings even though they can't find housing. The school is still paying money for artist to perform at their homecoming events while students' belongings are also being destroyed.

qg0pg3 submission Is this a legit thing? Found the 12 random words in my CB Wallet App on iPhone. I just type them in like he is leading me down to and it'll speed my recovery up?.. Is this a scam somehow? Website is legit 
hi349a3 comment We have a lot of newcomers entering the Bitcoin space recently who are exploring different exchanges and such. Some users are developing a habit of asking if various random websites some complete stranger PM'd them is a scam or not. Sometimes these sites are completely unrelated to Bitcoin. This is not the purpose of r/Bitcoin.

* Do not trust unsolicited messages telling you to check out some shady website.
* Do not trust Discord randos telling you that you won a prize.
* Do not trust anyone who promises guaranteed profits.
* Do not trust website with unpronounceable domain names
* Do not trust anyone claiming to give away free Bitcoin. (YouTube, Twitter, Discord)
* Do not trust anyone claiming they will double however much Bitcoin you send them.
* Do not trust 'pretty girls' on Tinder telling you about new investment opportunities.
* **If you have to ask** if some sketchy website or special offer is a scam, **then it probably is.**

You have to learn to think for yourselves. Recognize that there are many tricksters out there who will go to great lengths to separate you from your Bitcoin. Use your head and stay safe. If you send your Bitcoin to a scammer, it's gone forever. There are no refunds!

hi39jtr comment i was reselling for the first 6 months on secondary markets for 10-40% markups. then, after having a bunch of bank account shut down for running a p2p money transmission business, i just started day trading. and after the 2017 crash, i was all in (after shedding 1/2 of my stack trying to time it). and i have only traded very lightly since then.  which is what i recommend now. a light hand on trading. my most confident trade will be 30% of my stack. and that's only on an event like we had in march 2020. i didn't budge on the china mining fud because i knew it was actually super bullish.

hi37n8r comment tldr; SkyBridge Capital CEO Anthony Scaramucci urged investors to "do the homework on Bitcoin" and "understand what it is." He also suggested that investors read the white paper written by Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. Understanding Bitcoin inevitably leads to growing adoption as many prominent investors around the world realize the potential of the cryptocurrency.

hi3py99 comment A lot of people have not studied Bitcoin and many never will. Yet one day they'll use Bitcoin and may not even know. 
hi4klys comment I would say rather than just studying it, *understanding* it is key. I have been involved in one way or another with Bitcoin since 2012 and for a long time I *thought* I truly understood it. I would buy. Number would go up. I would sell.

But I was wrong, otherwise I would have never sold.

When the lightbulb moment finally hit, I immediately put a dangerously high percentage of my net worth into it and haven't looked back. Needless to say, I am *very* happy about that decision. I have better conviction and faith that Bitcoin is the future of money and value than most have in their deity.

Knowing what I know now...I will never sell a single sat for as long as I live. Selling Bitcoin in 2021 is like selling manhattan real estate in 1932, or Amazon stock in 2001.

Here is a very fun website. It shows you the current price on world population and how much Bitcoin per person is. :)
In regards to how much you hold, you can compare in percentile where you are at in terms of world population. :)

Edit: first ever reward! Thank you very much good anonymous sir! 
hi49e7y comment I'd never want to join a club that would have me as a member. 
hi36ba9 comment I think you are in a nice percentile. You will probably even get a lot of private messages soon from friends, you didn’t even know you have. 
- No seriously. Never talk or write about how much BTC you own in public. 
hi3arbm comment there is no club. there is no reward. and if you try to wear your bitcoin balance as a social credit badge, you're probably more likely to get kidnapped or mugged than to get any actual respect from peers.

hi36far comment What “1%” are you talking about?
If it’s the wealthy 1% then no- the threshold is around 11 Million USD.
A more relevant (albeit abstract) threshold is if you own 0.3 BTC, only 1% of the world will ever be able to own more than you. 
hi3lyns comment James from invest answers has done a couple vids on this topic and this guy knows his shit.   I believe he said you need to own like 3.2 BTC to be in the absolute top 1% of all holders.

qg1835 submission What do CBDC & blockchain have in common? 
hi3860o comment > So I fail to see why CBDC's require blockchain technology. 

That's because they don't. All you need to run a *centralized* digital currency is an SQL database. 
hi3biau comment That's what people don't understand, it's clinging on to that "digital currency" and "block chain" buzz word. It's almost like they want to misrep themselves as a legitimate cryptocurrency. 
hi3d6ac comment Won't lie, figured this would be a joke.  

Blockchain is often used for it's association with Bitcoin.  People try to pull the positive association of Bitcoin onto their shitty project.  People don't really understand the difference so they will think "oh everyone says Bitcoin is good so CBDC will be good too because they're both blockchains." 
hi38atq comment nothing at all. except their digital nature. which isn't much since most currency has been digital for decades already.  

although there are probably some technical aspects which they share. because it's actually not just as simple as doing an SQL database, since there are a bunch of different entities involved who need to be able to trust each other.  and just saying "trust me" isn't good enough.  so they'll probably use some kind of federated model, similar to bitcoin's "Liquid" side chain. not saying they will use that model exactly, but the federated organization and signing structure to spread the trust out enough where no one party can screw another one. what they'll end up with is some kind of pseudo-democratic voting model with some other complexities which i havent considered. which is starting to sound an awful lot like a proof-of-stake system. i could be wrong. it happens. 
hi38bw7 comment The answer is likely about clearing. Central banks have millions of transactions to their member banks and those banks to commercial banks. Plus the banks lend to each other etc. 

All these transactions need to be cleared, and that is a very tedious and expensive process. A blockchain takes care of the clearing automatically. 

Even if the network wouldn't be very decentralized,  the constituent banks could act as nodes, such that you'd get an intra bank network that automatically clears and keeps track of all these transactions in an efficient way.

Edit: also, the government and fed gain enormous power... but that isn't necessarily blockchain related. 
hi3dz64 comment CBDC won't use any kind of blockchain, the assets won't be digital bearer bonds, the big advantages for the central bank include giving them total control over all aspects of issuance, convertibility, transfer and removal from circulation, whilst also gaining them complete and thorough oversight over all aspects of the same.
A world where we all transact in CBDCs is one in which a small committee of people can be lobbied or otherwise coerced or plotted against or with to tip the table in any direction - to an even greater degree than is possible today.

The implicit social contract Central Banks have made with Big Corp, Banking and others that they will bail them out, at the expense of those on fixed salaries and those holding their savings in a national currency (those who control companies and own assets don't bear the brunt of this as they can raise prices).

Bitcoin fixes this - holding some amount helps it become more stable and loosens the grip these committees have over the path our lives take.

CBDCs are the opposite of Bitcoin - instead of known simple economic policy, they can implement incredibly complex rapidly changeable economic policy. Instead of control over your assets, they can ensure you have only the least control possible, instead of being able to attain privacy, they offer no possibility of privacy (only lip service)... instead of enabling greater accountability and transparency, they will "in the name of protecting privacy" offer none (unless you are part of their circle). Instead of Bitcoin's rock solid security, they offer a cyber security disaster waiting to happen. Convince me I'm wrong.. 
hi3l2al comment The only thing that they have in common is that they have both been used to sell a bunch of shitcoins the only difference however is that the Central Bank digital currency is the Ultimate Spy coin.

The only implementation of blockchain that works is Bitcoin everything else is just highly inefficient centralized games

hi39cgi comment [deleted] 
hi39za6 comment take some gains? you mean in dollars? why not give yourself more gains in the future? unless you have bills to pay, or some business venture or life improvement idea, never sell.  dollars are not the end goal. dollars are a failing system and will guarantee you a loss in purchasing power over time.  and that's not to mention the bloody military regime you are propping up by holding dollars or any fiat.

qg1y9n submission How much can I earn per month if I have 30 middle-end mining rigs? 
hi3b5zk comment Having "mining rigs" is just one variable of very many. What "mining rigs" are those? How much do you have to pay for electricity, and other operational costs (rent, maintenance etc)? There is no quick answer to that. There is also an amount of uncertainty because the answer depends on future difficulty of mining which we can't know. 
hi3ue7m comment The latest rigs Gross about $50/day at current BTC prices. 30 of those would gross about $45k per month depending on pool luck.

But…. There’s a lot more to running 30 rigs. The electrical costs and cooling required is a whole ‘nother level of headache. You can’t just plug those rigs in to normal outlets. Also each of those machines will output heat at about the equivalent of 3 blowdryers on high 24/7. If you don’t cool down the warehouse sufficiently, you will burn out the rigs the first day. You will also need to be somewhere where commercial electric rates are cheap, around 3-6cents per kw/h is ideal. (Less than half of what you’re paying at your home.)

For 99.99% of people, it’s way better and more profitable to just buy BTC at the scales you’re talking about.

For example, if you ordered 30 rigs 2 months ago, you probably would still be waiting for them to arrive, you’d already be paying for your commercial space and would have spent about $270k just on the machines and have not mined a single bitcoin yet. It would likely take you over a year to break even on just the machine and basic startup costs from the day you start mining. 

However, if you bought $270k of bitcoin instead, you would have already turned that into over $430k. 
hi3cci4 comment Impossible question to answer, TBH. This heavily depends on the mining rigs, current hashrate, current price of Bitcoin and (IMHO the most important factor) the cost of electricity at your location. 

You might also get a better answer in r/BitcoinMining so check that sub out, please.

**Also, this question was quite an invitation to all scammers to drop you a DM. Ignore them all or kiss goodbye any Bitcoin you send them.** 
hi3bdsy comment Whattomine.com is a good place to calculate earnings. It has the stats for most big miners and GPUs. You are also able to input your estimated electricity cost and see if it would actually be profitable to run miners. 
hi3bbiv comment Buying miners mid bull run is sure to work out well.

If btc tops in q1 2022 and crashes back to 40k for 3-4 years.  Will you be ok with the heat/noise/sunk cost/ electric cost for those 4 years? 
hi3bdng comment There are websites with mining calculators. You need to know electricity cost and hashes per second to know if it's worth it or not. 
hi3dqbf comment Yes, 30 mid range mining rigs 50Th each, would get you 1,500 TH.
That would mine : 0.009 btc per day and 0.28 btc per month

hi3y3ys comment >failed to implement RSK properly

Care to elaborate? What's RSK? How did they fail to implement it? How did the failure result in the loss of the block reward?

>sheer stupidity

What may surprise people is the miner would most likely not succeed in mining the block if they had constructed the block properly. Even the slightest change in the block complete changes the mining result. Their probability of mining the correctly constructed block is their hashrate / overall hashrate, which would be near zero. So, yes, it's unlucky that they didn't construct the block properly, but they didn't lose, or more precisely, fail to claim, the 12.5 BTC. Most likely. 
hi62jus comment Yep, thats the same thing.

qg2b9h submission Always Greener — Bitcoin Industry Now Uses the Most Renewable Energy in the World at 57.7%. Bitcoin’s progress in energy efficiency and sustainability is excellent. 
hi3m5hf comment Been mining my solar panel's excess production away since my electricity provider doesn't pay me for the excess energy I produce compared to my consumption. 
hi3jy1b comment This is only a temporary effect of Bitcoin being so young. Once mining competition increases more expensive non-green energy sources become unprofitable and it will use 90% green energy. 
hi3dqqh comment tldr; According to the latest estimates from Cambridge University, America now accounts for more than 42% of the Bitcoin network’s hash rate. Bitcoin mining consumes 3 times less energy than gold mining and 21 times less than the aviation industry. The Bitcoin mining industry is the one that “uses the most renewable energy in the world”.

hi3ecvi comment That is more important then any ATH etc. 

Wonderful development! 
hi4xozs comment even if it didn't use renewable energy and it was all coal powered

it would STILL be more ethical than the fiat system

built on wars, violence, and men with guns

locking people into a fiat prison where you can't get out because they keep printing money faster than you can save it

energy usage is FUD 
hi3diz5 comment China's ban on Bitcoin mining in May 2021 was a boon to Bitcoin on many levels.

The concentration of Bitcoin's Hash Rate in China is no longer an issue. America is now taking the lead in this area, and that is a much better thing because America's values are much better aligned with the values of freedom advocated by the Bitcoin system.

Bitcoin's ESG score is now much better, and the latest figures from the Bitcoin Mining Council show that the share of renewable energy in the electricity consumed by Bitcoin is now 57.7%.

Bitcoin's progress in energy efficiency and sustainability is excellent. 
hi3v24b comment The report this article is based on is hardly definitive.  It's a voluntary report from a fraction of the participants. 
hi3ys5m comment The drive for energy mining means exactly that more efficient use of energy and less waste is directly profitable. Nobody cared before that a huge amount of energy was wasted or unused. 
hi6foya comment I'm sure glad that renewable energy was used to put numbers on a computer, and not used to reduce emissions in actual productive industries.

qg2hq4 submission To all the advanced hodlers out here, please, any thoughts about this ? Is the energy crunch a real threat to the network? 
hi3gooa comment Thanks to the adjustable proof of work, even a large disruption of miners does not effect the bitcoin network in a way that impedes its function.

We saw that in action when china banned mining this spring. The fees rose a bit but that's it. and now thanks to jurisdictional arbitrage, the network is more decentralized than ever.

As for the hashrate/security side. Attacking the bitcoin network necessitates the full energy use of a small nation, this without taking into account the hardware needed. The higher the hashrate (or energy consumption + hash/W of the used hardware), the more the security.

So here we have an asset that gets more decentralized the more you attack it, that reacts to large disruption by adjusting itself to reward more the actors that secure the network and that requires the energy of a nation state to attack. I'll let you draw your own conclusions from there. Also don't trust me, check by yourself that it happens in this manner. 
hi3f8e0 comment First of all, I'm aware that CoinBureau is one of the more" serious "shitcoiners out there and that being a youtube pushes him to do clickbait alot. So I don't usualy take this guy too serious

Nevertheless, this thought had been going through my mind alot lately since the energy prices started pushing up.

I myself am a third wave hodler, and I see these facts important, as following:

1. The Nr. 1 biggest threat to the central banking cartel is Btc

2. The ESG narrative has tried to lay the basis (like Musk clown, at front) to disapprove Btc, but failed (for now).

3. The Energy crunch and further strong inflation is in the interest of Govts. and the central banking. 

4. the energy crisis has been provoked mostly by policy, not by" unevitable forces" (carbon tax, climate hysteria). 

5. The next attack will be try to shut down miners in the west, China style, through this kind of excuse: "grandma can't heat her house bcos of bitcoin mining"... 

In my eyes, if this gets worse and I think it will, this kind of lays a foundation for further bans on mining and discrediting Btc.

But what I can't figure out here, is it really a threat? Why does higher hashrates have anything to do with security, if the 51% attack isn't even a real threat? Why has energy usage or a hashrate anything to do with securing the network?

I'd be very thankful for your thoughts on this and feel free to call this Bs or whatever 
hi3l32k comment thanks for that answer.

I agree. Its been getting more resilient with each attack and its beautiful to watch.

So, in your view, a 51% attack would cause damage but not destroy the network, right?

(I know its an old topic, but I must have missed it somehow)

As I understand it, if most of the nodes won't agree with the new chain, then there will be a hard fork and thats it. Like what happened with Bcash 
hi3pio9 comment No in my view it would be quite stupid (and close to impossible for any actor) to use a small's nation worth of electricity during multiple days to do a double spend. Indeed we don't know how much is enough until it's too late but I would argue that even with a loss of 30-40% of the hashrate, the network would be hard to attack.

That's also why bitcoin is way ahead any other shitcoin.

qg2l4y submission I was wondering for a while now, what happens of I receive wrong currency on my address? 
hi3f6pq comment That doesn't happen with Bitcoin....ETH is not connected to BTC 
hi3f7ei comment Some wallets check for address inaccuracies, something like you describe can be prevented by some wallets but if not and the funds were sent, their gone. 
hi3ikcu comment You can give them the address but their software will choke on it and probably say "invalid address", preventing them.

They are on different networks and have different address encodings, which cannot mistakenly be cross-spent. There was a time when addresses of a fork could be mistakenly used on the wrong chain, but after numerous screw ups the forks fixed this by changing their address prefix/encoding values. 
hi3ygm6 comment [removed] 
hi4p69o comment In case of the coins in your example it would be impossible for anyone to make that mistake. These coins use different formats and checks for their addresses. Entering the address of one into a wallet of the other would be met with an "invalid address" error and the wallet would refuse to send anything.

Some coins have (or had) identical address encoding and checks, however. Most notably some BTC forks all at one point used addresses that start with "1" and "3". For backwards compatibility, a fork wallet may accept a "1" address as valid. In this case it would gladly send the fork coin even though your wallet is monitoring the BTC network. The transaction would confirm on the fork network, and your wallet wouldn't see anything since it's not a valid BTC transaction. If you have the private key of the address, you can import it into a fork wallet, which will then check the address on the fork chain and see the coins. If the address belongs to someone else, they are the ones with the key, so they must dig up the forked coin.

In some cases it may be impossible due to upgrades on BTC that aren't available on the fork coin, for example segwit.

qg2un1 submission Why now? SEC took eight years to authorize a Bitcoin ETF in the US 
hi3mbyf comment People. It's not a Bitcoin etf. It's a bitcoin futures etf. That is a tremendously big difference. They're not based on bitcoin. But on futures. Furthermore these are just cash settled. So there's no real relations between bitcoin and these future etfs. Besides them abusing bitcoin's name. 
hi4pbzc comment My guess is money. Fiat money. 
hi6avfa comment I tell you why: Because they need some more time to enslave us before the biggest crash of all times occures and people rising up. With #
Bitcoin ETFs they can pump the fiat bubble for the last time. And so they make Bitcoin unevitable winning which is less bad for them obviously. 
hi45jk7 comment I thought it was because the guy Biden placed in the SEC was pro crypto?

Crypto was still relatively small when Obama called it "a Swiss Bank account in your pocket"

And Trump seems to believe in the supremacy of the dollar.

It just wasn't big enough 8 years ago to warrant attention. And that was probably a good thing. 
hi3h4d1 comment tldr; The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved a Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) for the first time in eight years. The SEC has long argued that the market underlying these proposed instruments is nothing short of a minefield for unsuspecting traders. The futures-based model addresses many investor protection grudges that the SEC holds toward the physical Bitcoin products.

qg2uub submission Is Bitcoin Mining Still Profitable? 
hi3h483 comment tldr; Bitcoin mining is the process of earning bitcoins in exchange for running the verification process to validate Bitcoin transactions. Miners can profit if the price of bitcoins exceeds the cost to mine. Difficulty is measured in the hash rate, which measures the rate of solving the problem. The higher the difficulty rate, the less likely it is that an individual miner can successfully solve the hash problem.
