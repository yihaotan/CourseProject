hibnusf comment The cool thing is, Bitcoin doesn't care. 
hibrkmw comment I do subscribe to FIRE thinking as a motivation to work toward early retirement in a structured manner.

However I find most people in FIRE community believe that the path to FIRE has to be a) implement some sort of 80/20 or 60/40 equities vs bonds portfolio and b) throw all / vast majority of allocation to equities into passive index ETF, and they are clueless about BTC, stablecoins, or other alts and lump them all into the same ‚Äúdo not touch crypto‚Äù basket.

But when I encounter these folks, I just remind myself that _everyone will buy Bitcoin at the price they deserve_ and move on. 
hicglho comment Took one for the team. Thank you for your service.

You can lead a horse to water but can‚Äôt make it drink. 
hicj4bd comment The reason FIRE is considered powerful, is like you said, it is proven to be successful. 

We live in an interesting time, and have the opportunity to have gotten some unbelievable returns from crypto. Will this go on for decades to come? (Hopefully) With Bitcoin eventually be replaced by something better or cease to exist? (No one knows shit about fuck). 

I follow the FIRE Philosophy as it is proven to work. I have interest in crypto and think that it can help the average person quite a bit as it gains acceptance and the system grows and shows that it is resilient. Despite being a decade old the future of Bitcoin is unknown, where as owning VT or VOO or VTI or VXUS is pretty foolproof especially over a period of SEVERAL DECADES.

I think a lot of the haters are also resentful for hearing about crypto and rejecting it, and seeing massive gains that they have missed out on. 
hic0qdk comment Those people are right, but only if they are over the age of 70.

All you need to do is make sure you hold YOUR keys.  And if you have to use a custodian, and your custodian is acting funny or isn't trustworthy, then withdraw immediately.  You can't do that with gold and silver really. Not with large amounts, and not quickly or easily.

To see the chances for any BTC address lookup the [bitcoin privacy score](https://btctester.com/bitcoin-privacy-score/) of this address. The lower the score the more evidences exist tracing this address to exchanges. A high score means that it's not traceable now but it can go down over time. It depends on the behaviour of the person controlling the address. If transactions were done revealing the privacy this cannot be healed after the fact.

hidof89 comment I had this EXACT wallet and lost my wallet and recoverred it. Took me 4 years.

You must have saved a backup at one point. SAFETY-> Back up wallet.  Find that back up. It should be in /storage/emulated/0/Download/ 

Or maybe you emailed the file to yourself? Or maybe you saved it in google drive, drop box.

If you find this file, you can figure out the password using a python script. 

Once you figure out the wallet backup password all your history will appear and get updated to the current state. 

The feeling you get when it finally works is heaven. 
hibz8zw comment I have the same app on my phone. I checked the "safety notes" link in the app.  

It says to use the in-app backup feature rather than a backup of the phone's contents.  

I'm guessing that means the private key isn't easily accessible from a simple file based backup (although there is hope if the app source code is available).

Do you recall if you ever used the backup feature within the app and might've put the backup somewhere? 

Failing that,  working out where the app stored the private key, whether you have that file,  and how it was encrypted (if at all) are your best bet,  I would think. 

Sorry if a lot of this is obvious, just figured I'd share the thought process if I was in same boat. 
hibw36j comment The current source mentions a few filenames:

>wallet-protobuf

A physical extraction may be able to recover the deleted files, I have had decent luck with extracting and recovering phone data from wiped handset.

hid6jo5 comment **I'll do it.**

If you don't find a professional who can take your case, or don't want to risk giving your data to them, contact me here.

I'm better than a pro because I won't ask to see your wallet, I'll tell you exactly what to do publicly right here, where everybody can tell you if I¬†ask anything suspicious. I'll post the code on github for the world to see and check.

And I'll ask the same fee as a pro who will ask to see your files: 20%. Let's make that 19. You only pay if we find the keys. I'm at your mercy, you could literally not tell me the script works, I'm counting on you to be honest and not screw me out of my reward.

The plan: I'd write a script that bruteforces through the raw data and tries every position of combination and length so check if it's a valid key **You'd run it**, I would never have access to any data. If that doesn't work, we move on to more complex steps, until it stops being worth it.

I¬†have already done this btw, a few years back, though what I recovered was worth a bit under $1k at the time...

there's a saying that goes "stairs up, elevator down. stairs down, elevator up". it describes a sort of market psychology and typical structure of the charts.  like an army advancing into contested territory. you inch forward, maybe they see you and are just sitting back waiting for an opportunity.  they bait you in, and eventually pounce. the various enemy factions don't even have to coordinate with each other to do this, because they can see and hear if there are battles going on, and the geography aka charts will help tell the story of where the best place to attack might be. and because of the surprise attack, you retreat substantially, losing lots of the ground you thought you had already taken because of the seeming lack of resistance. everyone wants to get the best price they can, buyers and sellers alike.

Maxi Bitcoin hodler here BTW.

There is a video in that link and he says "**cryptocurrency** could become the world reserve currency of the world".  He did not say **bitcoin** in that video clip.

Is there a full video where he actually says "**bitcoin** could become the world currency of the world"? 
hic0shi comment tldr; US Senator Rand Paul has said that Bitcoin (BTC) may become the global reserve currency in the future, especially as people lose confidence in the government. Paul has belonged to the crypto community since 2016, at which point he claimed to accept Bitcoin donations for his campaign. However, no one can claim that there is a connection between trust in government and interest in cryptocurrencies.

*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.*

hic7ot8 comment qoute:
According to software engineer Lisa Neigut, the mempool, which is a temporary memory where transactions pending confirmation are stored in the Bitcoin blockchain, is an obsolete mechanism that must be eliminated, even if it negatively impacts individual mining, such as as he admitted.

In an e-mail sent to the specialized web group ‚Äúbitcoin-dev‚Äù, the expert suggested that by eliminating mempool, the bandwidth requirement to run a node would be ‚Äúgreatly‚Äù reduced and transactions would be kept private.

hict4y3 comment Hello teach got my wallet set up‚Ä¶ 
hidm44j comment You will need to give each student at least 0.00001 BTC (~0.60 USD).  That is effectively 2x the dust limit.  Since the minimum amount of mining fee for a transaction is 0.0000014 BTC, this gives them enough to move the balance maybe two times before the balance becomes dust and unmovable.

I'd also suggest you give them the BTC then make them move it to their own wallet.  If they don't do this by the end of class, then move the funds back to your own wallet.

I would HIGHLY suggest you give them 0.5 tBTC on testnet.  There are plenty of wallets that support testnet and it will give them more flexibility in movement.

In either case, the best way to do this would be to generate 50 (or whatever) BIP39-seed-mnemonics.  Then load the first address (`m/84'/0'/0'/0/0`) of each seed-mnemonic.  Then just pass out the seeds in sealed envelopes.

There are a handful of people across the exchanges effectively controlling bitcoin.  Disagree with me all you want.

As the 1st country to adopt bitcoin, those same people don't want El Salvador to look foolish because that hurts them.

Also, https://youtu.be/IetaaBPtS6I?t=97 
hicq508 comment Lol indeed 
hicb9dc comment I'm still of the opinion with approximately 60 days left "PlanB" will no longer be worshiped.

I can't have it both ways though so, either I will be proven wrong about PlanB's S2F model or Bukele being advised.  

As much as I do not want to admit it, I think PlanB will end up being correct and Bukele has been advised accordingly. 
hicayb7 comment I need it to go to 0 asap. 
hicijyj comment You‚Äôre delusional. The day El Salvador began its adoption of Bitcoin (Sept 7th) Bukele tweeted ‚ÄúBuying the dip üòâ150 new coins added‚Äù Bitcoin was at 51-50k. The next day Bitcoin fell over 15% and didn‚Äôt surpass 50k for nearly a month. A multitude of media outlets, and many others, mocked and literally called him a fool. Some still do. 

Over time Bitcoin will continue to increase in value; the only one who can prove to you that you‚Äôre wrong- is yourself.

hiccrv0 comment Trading bitcoin on margin..I have always played it pretty risky. But I don't lever cryptos ..  those guys have balls of iron, which are bound to be crushed by the hammer of volitility. 
hicifd3 comment Do they have deals that only get cut off at dips of 70%? That is the only way I'd even consider that shit, and I still wouldn't. Running one's eyes over the price line for any amount of time should clue people in that 10%+ dips are really common, this is not like stocks where 5% is some eye-turning catastrophic event. The game here is fundamentally different, and they're getting blown up for playing the wrong game. 
hicz535 comment There's no cure for stupidity.

Or greed. 
hicj46v comment If you used margin at 2 :1 ratio is might be ok..but everyone levers to some ungodly ratio 
hid04n3 comment The exchanges love leverage, they can see the order book and they can see your leverage ratio and they can see your stops......easy money.
So they lose a few plebs they know that we are still early and for every one they lose there will be a hundred more in 6 months. 
hicqfhc comment Sure.  Liquidation price depends on the leverage used. 
hickp2e comment Yeah, that's what I've used for stock trading, and even that can get risky. There's a lot of people that run 10x+, the complain when the price moves a few percent and they get liquidated. Kucoin paid out every who lost money on the last dip. But I'm sick of people bitching about losing their accounts lol 
hiyqqun comment Yeah for sure. I can see it in realtime. On KuCoin in particular, I probably own the top 1% of their KCS coin (thinly traded). If I put up an order of say 15,000 coins, I'll get immediately stepped by a 60,000+ coin order. I almost guarantee nobody on that exchange has that many KCS coins lol. In addition, the most KCS you can buy on margin is 30,000 coins, so it can't be a margin user either. At current price, that means I'm getting outbid +$1 million in coins.

I almost guarantee that's a bot ran by the exchange lol

hid2ysz comment Bitcoin is where all money flows into long term. It is the nash equilibrium of storing wealth in money. Anything else in the crypto space is just a count of how many leap frogs it takes to get to Bitcoin. Usually they leap all the way up to the platform tokens, and it takes one or two bear markets for retail to finally default to Bitcoin. 

Those billions you see outside the protocol are there because they got FUD out of their Bitcoin. 
higalc3 comment Time for my oft copy/pasted favorite metric; the one that doesn't allow me to ever be a bear.

Bitcoin yearly LOWS. The lowest trading price of each year:

2011 ‚Äì $0.30

2012 ‚Äì $4

2013 ‚Äì $65

2014 ‚Äì $260

2019 ‚Äì $3,322

2020 ‚Äì $3,850

2021 ‚Äì $28,800 (so far)

Hard to imagine posting a lower low this year. Remarkable!

qhftlp submission Question: If you have a node, do you need a hardware wallet? 
hicj8hr comment Yes.

The keys should be in a device that is never, ever, connected to the internet. You can do this with an old pc, a raspberry pi, etc. It doesn't have to be a dedicated hardware if you want to save money, or want to DIY.

A node is connected to the internet, so any wallet there would be a hot wallet. Not recommended for long term and/or high value. 
hicxix9 comment Best way to utilize the benefits of your own full node and your hardware wallet is to connect your hardware wallet to your node ;)  

The keys are stored on the hardware wallet, and everything is verified on the full node, and no leaking of privacy to third parties' backends. 
hiczv6o comment The node is for privacy, and for verifying your transactions exist.

The hardware wallet is a secure enclave single purpose transaction signing device (okay some don't have a secure chip, you might also use a Seedsigner, etc)

hicjlrr comment The only real threat is the millions of btc that are stuck in vulnerable outputs flooding the market. As for everything else it will be updated long before qc becomes a threat. 
hicjq0n comment lyn alden said something along the lines: to worry about quantum computing being a threat to bitcoin is as absurd as worrying about investing in oil because of the threat of nuclear fission making oil obsolete. 

no one who invests in oil seriously worries about nuclear fission destroying their investment even though nuclear fission is a possible but unlikely threat. 

sure quantum computing is a possible threat to bitcoin but is it likely? nope. at least not in our life time. 
hicjq3s comment It's hard to predict what a computer that doesn't exist yet can do. 
hicjxfi comment People generally disagree on how serious a threat it could be or even if it will be possible. A few things to consider.

1. If SHA256 were cracked then we‚Äôre all going to have a bad day. Lots of information systems are secured with encryption.  And SHA256 is pretty good.

2. If this happened would it be a nation state? And if so would they try to take some bitcoin or would they try to break into military or political infrastructure first to make the most of the element of surprise?

3. Bitcoin can fork, implementing a quantum resistant encryption algorithm if necessary. Or better yet, quantum computers could theoretically create better encryption algorithms to protect against malicious quantum computers.

4. Satoshi‚Äôs coins haven‚Äôt moved. IMO, the big wallets are the canaries in the coal mine if someone went after bitcoin and they‚Äôre still fine.

I‚Äôm no expert so perhaps someone in encryption or a related field can chime in or correct me. 
qhfybj submission How to recover Sent tokens USDT to exchange "Coinbase" on the wrong network BTC Omni lost missing can't retrieve recieve or find my transactions 
hicls9e comment Wrong sub 
hicnsrw comment Why ignore the big warning on Coinbase - make sure you send using the right network, or you lose your coins  

Coinbase used to support Omni USDT, so they might have a legacy technical skillset to recover your coins, as long as the ETH/USDT address is a valid Omni/USDT address  

This requires much manual work for Coinbase, and they'll expect you to pay their labor fee 
hicu49k comment Before, the warning did not exist on coinbase. 
This was three months before the updates and alerts they've added to their app. 
They stopped taking Omni only days before my order on 07/28/2021. 
Their website said accepts usdt Omni and in early July two weeks previously I had sent $450 usdt over Omni network to Coinbase successfully. 
They changed the rule and won't help me now.
They refuse in support emails to assist me.

I just needed an alternative using iancoleman.io bip44 to export private keys of the recieve address (Coinbase) and sending them to Omniwallet.org

"Sound money advocates lost the intellectual battle in the early years of the 20th century, and now the principles of this doctrine have been largely forgotten," he writes. "Stable money advocates sincerely believe that market-controlled money will periodically cause recessions, panics, and deflation, and therefore markets must be replaced by government actions," he adds.

qhi3ps submission This Simple Advice on Bitcoin From Satoshi Nakamoto Is All You Need To Know To Take Action. Owning Bitcoin just in case is more relevant than ever. 
hicuuwe comment Here is what Satoshi Nakamoto wrote in an email exchange on the "Cryptography Mailing List" in January 2009 just after the launch of Bitcoin:

>‚ÄúIt might make sense just to get some in case Bitcoin catches on. If enough people think the same way, that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.‚Äù

Satoshi Nakamoto had a very clear vision when he launched Bitcoin. Owning Bitcoin made sense, just in case. In case the success of the Bitcoin network becomes so great that the prophecy of this people-owned digital currency comes true.

Today, Bitcoin has more than 130 million users, and it‚Äôs safe to say that this self-fulfilling prophecy is just about to come true. So rather than having regrets about not knowing about Bitcoin in January 2009, you need to fully embrace the present by seeking to build the best future for yourself. 
hicw1ng comment tldr; Bitcoin is the first step in separating money from the hands of the State and giving the power of money back to the people. Satoshi Nakamoto had a very clear vision when he launched Bitcoin in 2009: Owning Bitcoin made sense, just in case. Bitcoin may fail in its revolution in the years to come, but the success of Bitcoin is inevitable.

hig13jg comment Those bastards at the post office censor all sorts of letters and parcels!

Granted mainly badly sealed packages, drugs and things that are a bit explodey, like batteries, aerosols and plastic explosive.

hicy5ox comment Can‚Äôt even get rid of scammers and spooks in bitcoin. I feel like that‚Äôs just human nature and they‚Äôre here to stay. 
hicxcog comment If it looks like a security, acts like a security, and trades like a security, it‚Äôs a security. The SEC gon‚Äô get cha.  
Gensler has at least postured that BTC is not a security. However, shit coins will have a very ugly reckoning day. 
hid8nx4 comment Sounds like you want regulation. Don‚Äôt you worry it‚Äôs coming. 
hicz0hj comment Do not concur. It‚Äôs like saying the internet should be for serious use only. Meme culture is internet culture and meme coins are an important part of crypto culture too. If meme coins bring more people into the crypto space - that benefits everyone who wants to see crypto replace FIAT. Bring it. 
hiczkzn comment This is like saying penny stocks should be eliminated from the stock market.  

Some coins are shit.  Some stocks are shit.  Pump and dumps have been around a lot longer than crypto.  In the long run, the ones that deliver real value succeed, and the ones that don't fail.

hicyat0 comment While I agree that the rules here are too restrictive, it's like that for a reason. Ask any OG, the 2015 -2018 fork wars was an extremely toxic time for this subreddit. People are financially incentivized to create their own coin, print themselves all the supply, and advertise it on here. 

There  are other popular Bitcoin subreddits other than /r/Bitcoin with more relaxed rules. You don't have to browse this particular one.

hicz8ju comment thanks for reply but i never mentioned any altcoin in that post that got removed,i was talking about the big picture and the link was to andreas antonopolous that was just talking about the same type of thing but just differently

but ya some may still have memories of that what happened but i think there was some very great lessons

the reason 'now' to be freaked of hardforks would be if you hold paper bitcoin cuz that would really put some fire behind them to not stray so far from satoshi law

hardforks im thinking lately will be with bitcoin forever and its a very good part about bitcoin cuz then the plebs always have choice but you need to hold your own keys to be a part of it all 
hid3pfo comment imagine that,a fork in the road and it even got a sign that says where it goes..so scary!

hid2u0a comment 
>There are about a million of Bitcoins making him worth 60B$ at the moment. 

There are not. The one million is just a myth. 
That's just a myth. Here's a reply u/thegreatmuffin [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/qeomod/if_satoshi_nakamoto_himself_had_secretly_mined/hhud611?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) recently:


Not true: https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ppwf5u/do_you_think_satoshi_has_an_exit_strategy/hd6piyg/  


That's also not true at all. There were multiple people running nodes/mining right from the beginning. Just a few hours ago there was an interview released with the person who (probably) was the 2nd node on the network, just few hours after the first software version was released: https://stephanlivera.com/episode/314/  

The first version of Bitcoin software didn't even start mining until it was connected to at least one other node, so all that "evidence" you speak about is bs (plz no offense, it's a commonly perpetuated myth/misunderstanding). 
hicy5ks comment That would be great actually. A lot of people would be shaken out while a lot of folks would accumulate in panic. 

But I don't think that a dumb that big would be seen at once. As they'd either sell OTC or slowly satoshi by satoshi.

hid19gc comment tldr; El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele on Wednesday announced that the Salvadoran government has acquired 420 more bitcoin, worth nearly $25 million at current prices. "It was a long wait, but worth it. We just bought the dip! 420 new bitcoin," he wrote in a post on Twitter. Earlier last month, El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin as legal tender alongside the US dollar.

qhjrdu submission Risk-free Bitcoin investment for close friends & family members? 
hid68wh comment Sounds like a great idea to me.  I‚Äôm from the US and we are out of control with the currency we are creating and like you said the rest of the world is there too.  
Another idea is to maybe just stack BTC for them.  I do that myself for family members with some cryptos and precious metals.  The fiat currency mind control is very hard to break until it‚Äôs too late.  Sometimes it‚Äôs just easier for me to stack and prepare for family and friends as well. 
hidde64 comment I‚Äôve often thought about buying some BTC as a Christmas present for family members - but buying it 5 years in advance, and then giving them the full value when the time comes. 
hidt198 comment My plan is to set aside a small % of my DCA for the next 4 years (maybe 1-5% or so) and divide it across a handful of addresses for close friends/family I fear might need it. 
higkcbz comment Yeah ,inflation gonna mess up millions of people live.bitcoin is the only way. 
hid4roc comment >when I get seriously worried about the money being printed all over the world and high risk of inflation

Can you be more specific? Where do you live? How much inflation did you experience in the last years? How much money do you think you'll lose due to inflation? 
hidfo3x comment This sounds great, in theory. But also like a good way to lose friends.

I suggest buying each an opendime (or ballet crypto wallet) or just making a letter with a seed phrase and an address. Loading it with ¬£10 or whatever. And then offering them "buy any amount from me and I'll load it on your wallet. If it goes down in value and you want the cash I'll cover it. If it goes up in value then its yours." 
hidg6n8 comment No such thing as a ‚Äòrisk free‚Äô investment. 
hidscey comment I did this for my family in 2017. They all sold however because they are weak.

qhjrup submission Scam? 
hid3bpw comment We have a lot of newcomers entering the Bitcoin space recently who are exploring different exchanges and such. Some users are developing a habit of asking if various random websites some complete stranger PM'd them is a scam or not. Sometimes these sites are completely unrelated to Bitcoin. This is not the purpose of r/Bitcoin.

* Do not trust unsolicited messages telling you to check out some shady website.
* Do not trust Discord randos telling you that you won a prize.
* Do not trust anyone who promises guaranteed profits.
* Do not trust website with unpronounceable domain names
* Do not trust anyone claiming to give away free Bitcoin. (YouTube, Twitter, Discord)
* Do not trust anyone claiming they will double however much Bitcoin you send them.
* Do not trust 'pretty girls' on Tinder telling you about new investment opportunities.
* **If you have to ask** if some sketchy website or special offer is a scam, **then it probably is.**

You have to learn to think for yourselves. Recognize that there are many tricksters out there who will go to great lengths to separate you from your Bitcoin. Use your head and stay safe. If you send your Bitcoin to a scammer, it's gone forever. There are no refunds!

hid6z5a comment [deleted] 
hidohms comment Preface: not a trader just a person that focused on bypassing financial censorship in this space. 

It's been tried, but to be honest unless you are looking for specific kink stuff the Market is flooded with endless supply of free porn. After the Pornhub purging and OnlyFans tried their BS of to kick off Adult content there was some possible momentum and you'd think alts like CUM would have taken off. 

But, sadly it's just not likely because the the demand is marginal at best. 

This reminds me how diametrically opposed sex workers are in real life to that in the digital World, wherein the ladies from Backpage learned to use it rather quickly [0] (with the help of the community) in order to operate when Visa/MC shut them down (the irony of MC coming out recently is not lost on me) but cam girls/online who you'd think would be more tech savvy sex workers would rather continue to use centralized platforms that essentially act as middle men and rent seekers for something they could host on their own Mega server and a basic foursquare page if they had the followings. 

As a person who mainly focused on financial censorship in this it's not lost on me that sex work was always the canary in coal mine and sadly I don't see how an alt solely built for this purpose [1] this inspires any confidence that crypto will do anything revolutionary for them:
