hf5x5s3 comment Hodllllll 
hf60vsu comment What would be the disadvantage of paying for something in BTC if you have the cash to then buy the same amount in BTC?

Wouldn't this give more utility to it and therefore help the price go up? 
hf787op comment Can‚Äôt. I already spent all my bitcoin on pizza a decade ago.

hf6htfw comment The disadvantage of spending crypto is that you're taxed on spending crypto.  Keeping track of individual BTC transactions is gonna be a huge headache. 
q071dn submission Visa announces support for crypto on their site: "Big things can happen when you combine crypto with the power of one of the world's largest payment networks."

hf619rg comment > "Big things can happen when you combine crypto with the power of one of the world's largest payment networks."

Translation:  

Our big company can make a lot of money off people who get all excited by the word 'crypto' because they don't stop and think. 
hf6y8bd comment This is like saying "Big things can happen when you combine Bittorrent with the power of the largest video rental chain." xD 
hf70x1b comment >"Big things can happen when you combine crypto with the power of one of the world's largest payment networks."

I'm genuinely interested.  How can you convince me to let you take a cut?  XD 
hf6dw4k comment The bitcoin network is going to disintermediate the intermediaries. It‚Äôs too powerful a disruption. Visa, MasterCard, Western Union, PayPal. They are done, they just haven‚Äôt accepted it yet. Adding candy aisles to the movie rental store. 
hf6pmy5 comment Still feels backwards they say it like that. Feels like they're saying "sidekick". 
hf6dt2q comment Lightning is going to put Visa out of business.

Visa thinking they are needed to facilitate crypto transactions is like a postal service thinking they are needed to facilitate email.

hf92qw4 comment [Strike.me](https://Strike.me) requires no KYC for up to $100 per transaction, max $1,000/week.

hf6ed4u comment My wife is white.  So is her mom and dad.  I‚Äôm pretty sure her grandparents on both sides are white too.  

Just wanted everyone to know since we are sharing. 
hf66bsg comment I would say no since she‚Äôs Vietnamese. If she were Japanese or even Thai, maybe, but Vietnamese? Nah don‚Äôt do it bro. 
hf6c7xp comment She can‚Äôt touch that money, regardless of her ethnicity. It‚Äôs a legacy gift.

Inheritance from family is not considered marital or community property. That‚Äôs your individual property. That‚Äôs the law.

*Drops gavel*

q07zvm submission Can an outside party find out that different accounts in my wallet belong to the same wallet/owner? 
hf6fdvp comment If for Ledger an "account" means what it means in BIP32, BIP44, BIP84, etc., which is just an index whose default is 0, then there is no way to connect them to one another. If one account's master private key was compromised/leaked, then the other accounts in the wallet are safe. I believe this is part of what it means that the account number in the derivation path is "hardened." Sibling nodes in the key pair hierarchy cannot be derived from one another... that would require knowing the private key of the parent node.

My initial "if" is because I don't own a Ledger so I don't know if what they mean by account is the same as what I think of as the account number which is part of a wallet's derivation path. 
hf6942g comment If that is important enough for you, buy two separate wallets, with two separate seed phrases. 
hf6mfk3 comment if you are using ledger live, then you are telling ledger everything.   

you should use a tor native wallet with your hardware wallet instead of using the provided software.  mycelium or samurai are good choices imo. 
hf6yqxm comment Generally no. And it's a good idea to separate some of your funds. Personal and business. Spend and save. Whatever. Sometimes when you send a lot multiple addresses will get combined. It's clearly seen then that both addresses belong to same person. With separate accounts btc will not be combined from one account and another.

q08dm6 submission Lyn Alden - Bitcoin is The Best Performing Asset? 
hf6ctl5 comment Lyn is great. Superb writer and I follow her work. But BTC is so speculative that sure it has been great for people that held from 8 years ago. Will BTC see another 1,700,000 % increase to eclipse the size of the world economy. I don't think so.

hf6emrs comment Do you have any idea how long, expensive, and complicated it is to get a nuclear plant up and running?

Well, I don't, because this article is restricted in my part of the world. Thanks for protecting me from this information, Big Government! 
hfbiapj comment This is working good. Each unit generating 1350 Megawatts per hour. 
hf6zvd5 comment I just wrote a school paper on how underrated nuclear energy was. Cool to see it being used on the future! 
hf6otbp comment Is the bitcoin just there to provide base load so they can provide other power to consumers more efficiently? Otherwise the optics are a little bad. 
hf6v944 comment No where in the article does it mention Nuclear.  Also, they broke ground on phase 1, a data center.  Phase 2 is bitcoin and is just planned.

&#x200B;

Did you actually read it before you posted it?

hf6rwg8 comment The dark web, despite what abhorrence may reside there, is a valid use case for Bitcoin. The entire point of censorship resistance is to transact with a party that a bank or someone else would otherwise **tell you not to**. 

At any point in your life thereafter you could have done your own research and formed your own opinion. 

We‚Äôre still early in this grand experiment. Sure it won‚Äôt be life changing wealth like those who got in early but it will still be wealth that no one can just rob you of.

hf6catm comment Having children is a form of selling out to authority and establishment. It's a sad truth that the vast vast majority of parents are dumb slaves. And while your parents were busy fucking and squeezing out babies, and jockeying for a big enough salary to pay for your college, the corrupt institutions were telling them what to think and say to you about reality.  And all the while, taking more than half of their money for the privilege.  The world is deeply corrupt.  Our family values and traditions have been used to control us. The matrix is more reality than fiction. And unfortunately, once you realize this, you have a decision to make about whether to continue playing the game and pretend the corruption doesn't exist, or be hated and marginalized by everyone who has chosen to do so. I prefer the latter, since most people are no better than pets anyway. 
hf7d058 comment Cool, what did they teach you about 9/11 in school? 
hf6evle comment A kid in my IT security class talked about Bitcoin and how people used in Dark Web to buy illegal things, I got curious and I remember thinking if I ever got it one day government would think anyone who has bought Bitcoin might have done something illegal and question them someday. Thats why I stayed out of it and forgot about it until I found out it became 15,000 lol when I heard about it first, it was 2009. I been wondering how many online criminals became millionaires for using bitcoin in its early stages.

q08xe9 submission Deciding between Casa and DIY multisig 
hf7ohwr comment With Casa you're paying for:

* Ease of use
* Recovery Key
* Premium Support

If you're comfortable managing a DIY multisig setup then you probably don't find much value in being able to hop on the phone with your advisor. 
hf6hmle comment Gonna echo other sentiment here. Can look into Sparrow Wallet, Spectre desktop.

Also cheap smartphones: a simple video tutorial walk-through in this case using bluewallet: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJ7W2NpLRiQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJ7W2NpLRiQ)

Maybe get some used cheap pixel phones without using any SIM cards and flash Calyxos on them.

You're on the right track whichever way you go as I think Multi sig is important to protect wealth & protect against loss for all including individuals, families, businesses, governments, or nonprofits. A scheme of 2 of 4 is probably fine. But to secure alot of wealth perhaps a 3 of 7 Multi sig & hand a copy of key over to separate friends & family and/or entities (church, lawyer, bank, crypto service)? Even if one stores it wrong or loses it, you are okay. Whenever you need to spend, just use three keys yourself. If something were to happen to you, make sure the others know that the other has a different key, so they can recover and transition to your descendants. 
hf7m0ml comment If you know very well what you're doing then there's no reason to pay casa. They do add some convenience though.

hf6jflm comment There is no similarity whatsoever.

hf6m2a6 comment Tulip mania only lasted a couple of years, Bitcoin has been around for more than 10 years, and has survived multiple boom/bust cycles.  Bitcoin‚Äôs value comes from its utility (current and future, similar to stocks) as a means of rapid and inexpensive transfer of value. 
hf6islh comment anothe way to agure this is to point out the similarity of the US Dollar to the Mississippi Bubble  [https://youtu.be/diEVmQZ1QfM](https://youtu.be/diEVmQZ1QfM)  which of course was a bubble caused by and ended  hyperinflation.

hf7juz3 comment The scam is that they'll tell your friend of enormous profits and when he wants to withdraw the e.g. $100k they ask him for $5k taxes in bitcoin which sounds not so much when you expect $100k. After he pays the $5k they motivate him again to invest and only when he stops paying they block communication and run away with his money. Many people told me stories similar to this.

If someone fell victim like this via bitcoin then the transactions cannot made undone. The only chance then is to trace scammers to exchanges where law enforcement can freeze the scammers assets. If the scammers address and transactions are traceable already you can [lookup here](https://btctester.com/bitcoin-privacy-check/). The lower the privacy score of the scammers BTC address the higher your chance that it can be tracked to one or more exchanges.

hf736iu comment >What would happen if a big company say like Coinbase was to go under or stop operations. And you had a wallet with Coinbase, would you lose all funds?

You would probably lose part or all of your coins. That's why we often say in this sub the "Not your keys, not your cheese". 




>Where can you securely put your funds and pass down wealth and such without the need of a company to allow you to hold.


A few good wallet choices:

[https://blockstream.com/green/](https://blockstream.com/green/) \- Top Security Features, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://bluewallet.io](https://bluewallet.io/) \- excellent, easy to use wallet, Open Source and Non-Custodial (although, Lightning is custodial!)

[https://www.wasabiwallet.io/](https://www.wasabiwallet.io/) \- Excellent privacy, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets.

Lightning wallets to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for very small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix works on Android

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - Android or iOS, excellent POS for small business owners as well as integrated Bitrefill or LN Pizza

[https://muun.com/](https://muun.com/) \- Muun, simple and elegant LN wallet - Android or iOS

Hardware Wallets (to store larger amounts):

[https://trezor.io/](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're.

[https://coldcardwallet.com/](https://coldcardwallet.com/) \- ColdCaard is currently the safest and most recommended here.

There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend as not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, etc. Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. 

Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. Write them down on any piece of paper as well as the receiving address. Now wipe the wallet and generate a new wallet. If the seed words are different than the first set, you're safe to use it. 

Find an option to set a passphrase and use it. This will boost the security to another level. Never store the seed words and passphrase together. Use a different medium if possible. If somebody finds both, they'll be able to steal your coin. 

This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. 



>Same with ledger.

No worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words and passphrase(s) safe.

Welcome to the rabbit hole and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions anytime during your Bitcoin journey. 
hf73t44 comment I'm not an expert, but my understanding is that your wallet containing the bitcoins is connected to the Blockchain. The seed phrase is just a proxy for your private key to that wallet. Even if the specific software company you use for your wallet goes under, the seed phrase will still give you access to your wallet through another wallet software because the system for seed phrases is somewhat standardized. 
hf725ym comment Thats why you should transfer coins to a hardware wallet. Even if ledger, trezor etc. Go out of business you can still use recovery phrase to get access to your coins on a different device 
hf7po43 comment If you store your coins on the exchange you might lose them, if you have them in a private wallet you're good

This is why people say not your keys not your coins, you need a private wallet and to be fully responsible for the seed phrase 
hf7azml comment The company would be liquidated. The government would appoint Trust Liquidators who would liquidate the company assets as calculated on a set date. They would publicise it and ask any creditor to apply for what the company owes them. This includes customers. 

You would not get any coins back. Instead you would get money. 

The first thing is they would pay dues to IRS if any then to clients. All clients would be paid proportionally to what they own vs what is left from the money. 
hf74x4l comment IMHO you should spend a little bit more time understanding how a wallet works or basically how your Bitcoins are associated with a wallet.

If you currently use Coinbase, then that means they have created a wallet for you. It means that this wallet lives on the Bitcoin Blockchain, HOWEVER THEY own the keys for that wallet. Now if they go down, you‚Äôve lost access to that wallet. That‚Äôs why everyone recommends to transfer your Bitcoins to a wallet which YOU control, e.g. by using a hardware wallet like ledger or trezor. With one of these devices, the device creates a new wallet for you on the Bitcoin Blockchain PLUS the keys to it. Now you own your wallet and you can store the hardware wallet in a safe place. In case that hardware wallet breaks or the Company behind that hardware wallet goes down, you  use the keys that were created with your wallet to restore everything (on any trustworthy service or even on your own by running open source Bitcoin wallet software). Since the keys are hard to remember, those keys are usually ‚Äútranslated‚Äù into a 12 or 24 keywords seed, which you should store safely. Again - It‚Äôs your keys to your Bitcoins. 
hf73r8m comment When I was.looking into exchanges this was my number one thing I looked into.

Crypto.con has an extensive process for this.
All your funds are segregated and in the event of a collapsed exchange, your funds go into escrow and can be returned to you. The keys may even be sent to you. 
hf77iab comment About coinbase going down, see Mt. GOX history. I still got bankruptcy letters. In short, you loose everything 
hf7h44p comment If you hold your coins with a company and the company does not provide you the ‚Äúkeys‚Äù to access your coins, then if the company goes under, your coins are gone. 

However, if you hold your coins and have access to the keys that unlock the coins, no matter how many exchanges or hardware wallet companies go down you can access your coins. This is because each wallet uses the same standard way to unlock your funds given a key. In short, this standard method is done by deriving a master key from a set of 12 to 24 words and deriving child keys from this master key. If you would like to read more about this standard, have a look at BIP-44.

So if you keep your keys (mnemonic phrase) safe and secure, you will have full control of the coins locked by that key. 

Please feel free to PM me if you‚Äôd like to know more. I recently started diving into the technicalities of Bitcoin and would more than love to share.

hf7tjmp comment Its way beyond the resources of any nation to attack the network through sheer hashing power. It would cost hundreds of billions if not trillions, and an unimaginable amount of manpower, take a decade to build the capability up in terms of manufacturing and for that you get to double spend some transactions for a single block.

I‚Äôm not convinced its even remotely possible even if said nation had all the will in the world to do so.

hf9kett comment For $2 trillion dollars I could destroy bitcoin. People don't realize how much money that is. 
hfapq4w comment I think it would be quite difficult to pull this off. There is natural demand for stock of Asics so no one has a huge stockpile ready to go. Building out infrastructure to house the Asics is also extremely costly and takes time to do. We can see from the recent Chinese ban that miners had a lot of issue rapidly obtaining rack space even when they possessed the hardware.

And we should think about the political incentive of doing this also. It's likely no party would want to incur the cost of spending 2bn of currency devaluation and trying to justify this and expect to garner voter support. 
hfbbiyx comment It would be great for someone to hijack ADA or any other piece-of-shit coin, and wouldn't require owning the coins. A PoS attack is possible by buying empty private keys from the stakeholders who mined previous blocks. This type of attack would be really cheap  

Governments are not able to make enough Bitcoin miners to 51% attack Bitcoin. Bitcoin mining ASIC manufacturers have a shortage. Then, if miners became available through some manufacturing magic trick, there's no government in the world which has access to 5GW of spare electricity generation capacity. It just doesn't exist  

You're about the 60th person to make this lame suggestion 
hfbbnlr comment > the community could easily hard fork the chain to a time before

They couldn't. That would require "the community" to be centralized. It isn't 
hf8pq5v comment That‚Äôs a good assumption. Even though it would create a lot of chaos in the crypto community e.g. how would exchanges deal with customers who already spent fiat to buy ‚Äúinvalid‚Äù coins etc.

Still the power of decentralization and community to detect that kind of attack is one of the main advantages of Blockchain. IMO the most risk does not come from the US gov, but from the Chinese gov. They are against Blockchain, and they have the authority to spend any amount of money they want (the US would have to justify the trillions spent to their tax payers)

hf7lxcb comment It's a lottery. The more hashing power you have, the more tickets you buy. 

So yes, it's possible that you only buy one ticket and win. It's just highly improbable. 
hf7l44l comment Ye so essentially who ever solves a complex problem gets the full block reward but the computation needed for this is not suitable anymore for individual miners hence mining pools where the rewards are divided by how much computing power you put in regardless of who solved the block. There is a very very slim chance that you could solve a block on your own pc but you probably never will as you dont have enough computing power to solve it and your competitors are large mining pools. But hypothetically you could play the ‚Äúbitcoin lotto‚Äù by setting up your own mining rig and not join a pool 
hf7plqd comment It's possible to find a block without a mining rig, just as it's possible you win the lottery every week for a year. 
hfbaw4m comment > Is it the person who solve the correct combination who gets it

Not exactly. The miner builds a block full of transactions. The first transaction pays the reward. This used to mean that the miner makes a transaction with his own address, and pays the reward to himself, if he wins the guessing race  

Today, there are 1.5 million Bitcoin miners and only 52000 blocks are mined per year. If the miners pay themselves, each miner wins one block every 28 years. This makes no sense for the miners, so they all join mining pools. The miners put the pool manager's address into the reward transaction. Miners send statistical information to their pool's server while they're mining. The pools receive the reward payments, and a pool distributes its rewards to its members (the miners) in proportion to each miners' work

> using a good PC to mine

Nobody has used a PC to mine Bitcoin for more than 8 years. Stop reading out-dated blogs 
hf823iv comment Mining Bitcoin is only profitable with the latest 
ASIC hardware and low electricity costs.  The difficulty is so high that individuals join large pools of miners.  

If a pool actually is lucky enough to find the solution for the latest block everyone in that pool gets a percentage of the reward (6.25 Bitcoin currently ) based on the amount of work they did in the pool (their hash rate).  The pool charges a fee which comes off the top first.  The hardest thing for people to wrap
their heads around is that luck is involved in mining and that every 10 minutes/block the luck of finding the solution is reset.  Some days your pool gets really lucky and you earn more rewards but other days your pool finds a few or no blocks and you get no rewards - it all averages out but it sucks when you are paying so much for electricity! Mining is a guessing game and statistically those who guess
Most are more likely to guess the solution but luck is involved so sometimes a smaller pool gets lucky- it happens less frequently but it happens.

Could you mine Bitcoin with older hardware or a pc - yes but the cost of electricity would be higher than the tiny rewards you received.

Solo mining with ASIC hardware and finding the solution to a block would be like winning the lottery with higher odds than the lottery.  Solo mining with a PC and finding the solution to a block would be improbable due to the vastly higher odds.

hf7slpd comment People take loans to access their wealth without selling and paying taxes. And you can borrow less than 50% LTV. 

Only degenerates maximize LTV and borrow more than they can pay back during volatile conditions. 
hf7wl10 comment No.  

Fools will weep.  

I would ***never*** risk my Bitcoins in such a manner. 
hf7mjk9 comment \> That's it, there is no other use case for lenders wanting your BTC.

So what about market making and Arbitrage? 
hf7nr4c comment Its another way for hodlers / investors to essentially be liquidated and parted with their sats. Completely agree 
hf80743 comment Don't use leverage to buy or sell BTC...ever 
hf8fqpi comment 
>The reason is this: *The only thing anyone  does with your lent Bitcoin is sell/short it.* That's it, there is no other use case for lenders wanting your BTC.

This is unequivocally false. Market makers need to borrow BTC in order to keep a neutral exposure to BTC which is required to minimise their risk.

You clearly haven't done enough research on sec lending. 
hf7mkaq comment Unpopular opinion: people who start Reddit posts with unpopular opinion are really irritating. 
hf7neh2 comment In my experience your first sentence is incorrect. I've been able to pull excess collateral out of a loan when the btc value went up, as long as I stayed above the minimum required collateral threshold.

hf7pu7o comment I believe that was HSBC. 

I use Barclays and they have never caused me issues. 
hf7sz6t comment I doubt you‚Äôll have any trouble receiving fiat from binance in any uk account. Sending fiat might be different. I sent some money to coinbase as I have many times over the last 3 years and had to spend 20 mins begging Lloyds. Bunch of cvnts. 
hf7wqlb comment Transfer first to a reputable exchange, such as Kraken, and then liquidate to fiat; else you can fully expect to join the ranks of those currently ruing Binance's non-existent customer service when your funds are likewise 'flagged for review'. 
hf8meqp comment You don't get Bitcoin from a bank. 
hf8s5l1 comment Revolut if you are UK, no doubt about it 
hf9i1av comment The bank which clamped down on Binance was Barclays.  I used to bank with them for many years and can honestly say Barclays is a scammy bank.    They have lots of hidden fees, bad customer services and generally are a bad bank in my eyes.  I could go into all the terrible stories I've had with that bank, but I'll leave that for another time.

&#x200B;

I now exclusively use Halifax.  Halifax is a great bank (my parents and relatives have been banking with them for 20+ years).   Halifax is a very fair bank, based on all the products I've used (even stock brokers account).    I have had no problems buying on Binance with my Halifax bank account.   I only had a problem once with Halifax, but that's because I entered my password wrong too many times in to the app and got my account locked.  It was all sorted out the next day however, when I went to a branch with my passport.

&#x200B;

I would highly recommend Halifax.  HSBC is like Barclays, they're shit in the UK too.

hf8960t comment I like how he puts a philosophical/spiritual perspective to the financial revolution of bitcoin.

What we are going through at the moment is a deep social/spiritual transformation. It's not just "new money".

Bitcoin happens to be the most efficient storage method of that time and work.

hf8yggl comment ###Bitcoin is monetary form of energy

That‚Äôs what I learned from him and looking up at money‚Äôs history I finally understood it. That‚Äôs why I cringe when people say PoW is bad as oppose to PoS. Most people don‚Äôt understand the relation of energy and money.

Always listen to the full episode too, Robert condenses and summarizes the conversation in only the way he can.

hf885o9 comment I watched a short documentary of bitcoin beach and looked at street sellers using their phone as a ‚Äúcard payment machine‚Äù to accept bitcoin from tourist buying half a dollar worth of souvenirs. This is very encouraging for me to see.

I come from Vietnam where 80% of small businesses are ‚Äústreet sellers‚Äù like this. No fancy company, just some coconut leaves and insane skill to make souvenirs and snacks to sell. They set up a shop by the street side, accepting cash from passerby and tourists. Most if not all of those people in El Salvador have a machine to accept payments now at the cost of 0, plus a payment account in dollar and a saving account in bitcoin now to shelter themselves from dollar inflation.

hf7y8cv comment It seems like even a small number of high tech jobs, people in my time zone for example I can work with remotely, would have a relatively big effect -- the huge dependency on remittances does not indicate much of a local economy.

hf8nljc comment > It seems like even a small number of high tech jobs, people in my time zone for example I can work with remotely,

Anyone capable of doing that was probably already doing it.  Just because there's a government project mining Bitcoin with a volcano now doesn't mean the population is going to get into "high tech".

Brave browser was to pay advertising companies / users with basic attention token BAT (a shitcoin).

Don‚Äôt know how far the project is but you might want to see another subreddit as ressource about this project. 
hf80jj7 comment I use it. You earn BAT. Basic atomic tokens. You payed out for them once a month, this month it is Oct. 7. You see an ad pop up, and you just click it, don't got to read it, and you earn by clicking on ad. You can set how many ads pop up. Mine is at max at 10. Once you accumulate 15 BAT, then you can make an account and send them to another exchange, and trade them whatever crypto.

hf84xw0 comment Did you try turning it off and then on again? 
hf8ijyy comment The room will not affect it, it‚Äôs just if you can get it very cool you can overclock it but IME they run at hash rate up to the shutdown temp

Are you having the hash figure from the miner or from the pool?

If it‚Äôs from the miner then it‚Äôs probably about right, it may be 85ths +\- 10%

You may find this particular sub quite anti mining which is odd as it‚Äôs a Bitcoin sub but it‚Äôs frequented by people that know nothing about the subject yet feel qualified to comment (see below) 
hf8zvcu comment Firstly, the advertised hashrate of asic miners is almost always under perfect conditions. It is also likely that this miner has a performance slider to increase and decrease hashrate. Secondly, the chips on the Asic board are likely starting to go. They are shorting out sometimes which lowers hashrate and will make the machine restart. Asic miners are extremely sensitive to heat and are going to have real trouble ever running in a basement, especially these high hashrate machines. Going to give you some brutal honesty when I say that if you keep running these machines they are just going to end up frying all the boards and you'll be left with maybe 25% hashing power. I would personally sell these "as is" at a discounted price and maybe someone will buy them.
