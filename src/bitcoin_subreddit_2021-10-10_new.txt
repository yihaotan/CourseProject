hg1mk4u comment The bitcoin (dot) com domain is owned by a convicted felon who describes himself as "Bitcoin Jesus" and has a long history of unscrupulous behavior. From [vouching for MtGox solvency before it collapsed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/77vrek/roger_ver_on_mtgox_bitcoin_exchange_for_the/), to promoting Craig Wright [as if he were Satoshi Nakamoto](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/776fim/funny_how_all_the_criminals_and_fraudsters_in/), the owner acquired the "r / btc" subreddit and packed its mod team with paid employees to spread divisive misinformation about the bitcoin protocol and various individuals in the bitcoin space, including this subreddit as a whole. He has also leveraged the domain and subreddit to promote an impostor altcoin to unsuspecting newcomers as if it were actually Bitcoin. As such, the domain is considered malicious, and the r/Bitcoin mod team kindly asks that readers seek out credible sources to post instead.

q4xgq7 submission Bitcoin Multisig where you require one specific party 
hg1r7ej comment Create a 1-of-2 multisig address.  Use that address plus the specific address to create a 2-of-2 address.  To sign a transaction for that account, you will need the specific x address plus either of the other 2 addresses using the 1-of-2 address. 
hg1znbz comment Hmm, in most cases what you'd really want is just a standard bitcoin address. If one is always required to spend, the others are just "permission to spend"..?

You could do this with standard multisig, just need to make sure you own the spender has a majority of the keys, and the permission givers are less than x.

So if x is number of keys required to spend, and "A" is the only one who can spend, and B is everyone else, then A>=(1/2)x where A<x, and A+B>=x I think?

Just means the spender might need a lot of addresses which is inconvenient though. Maybe there's a way to "combine" addresses to simplify that? 
hg4bc8w comment you could do this using the script programming language built into bitcoin. but crucially there are no wallets out there that do this already. you're going to have to roll your own.

hg1oc7o comment Depends on the country. You don't need to declare what you own. If you sell some or all of it you have to show cost basis, or what you bought it for. If you can't prove the cost basis it will be set to zero and entire sum will be taxed.

hg2vd60 comment Why wouldn't you be able to sell your property?

Depending on your country/citizenship/etc you might be able to reduce the taxes you have to pay in capital gains if you've held it for a long time (at least a year). For example, Australia gives you 50% reduction in taxes, Germany gives you 100% reduction in taxes, etc. Ah, and if you're in El Salvador, you won't pay any taxes anyway as it's legal tender. You'll have to check out the specifics of your situation. 
hg3havw comment Beware of https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft_by_finding 
hg472xa comment Well you do not have to declare it in the UK if you simply take out a loan against the BTC, if you buy anything with the BTC it would incur capital gains tax, even trading it for a different crypto is classed as disposing of the asset and would incur capital gains.   


If it is a significant amount talk to a tax lawyer / accountant they may be able to work some magic and reduce your tax burden

hg47ymm comment So say you look it at this way- what’s to stop you from ‘acquiring’ a large amount of bitcoin through trading goods, then making this quantity of bitcoin legitimate by setting it up to look like it was acquired by finding an old wallet, which had just accumulated value? Surely, (if you did find an old wallet with a lot of money inside) questions would be asked about the origin of your bitcoin if you suddenly started trading huge amounts of bitcoin for fiat currency?

Leverage trading at crazy values like 4x is only appealing if the price can swing 10% or more rapidly. Leverage trading will move to the next thing and eventually Bitcoin movements will become like the SP500 where most days will see movement in the 1% range. 
hg3ibj0 comment Don't use leverage....we are in a consolidation phase and there will only be a few exchanges...to maintain there customer base they will become more "regulated" thus limiting the "wild west" trading going on right now....as fiat becomes hyper inflated BTC owners will not risk their BTC as the smartest strategy will be to HODL 
hg262qf comment It's an interesting topic, but there's no way to know the future.  As long as exchanges with high leverage, and a solid focus on Bitcoin as a speculative investment, remain common, so will low timeframe volatility.

Some mature markets, like crude oil futures, move very similarly to Bitcoin.  Obviously not as volatile, but the forces that move the market are very similar. 
hg6brw5 comment I think it will stay as long as btc is around people will trade it with high leverage in hopes to make big returns. Like oct 6 https://www.bybt.com/LiquidationData look at how many short were liquidated around when btc made it’s big push to 55k all it would take is a 1-2% move to liquidate people holding large positions on 100x margin . Jus My opinion tho 
hg28inm comment Gotcha, I remember the first time I saw it happen, shorts got rekt on July 25th-26th. I was watching bitcoin on [aggr.trade](https://aggr.trade) and was like, "what in the flying fuck is going on?!?" 
hg4yt9s comment i don't because i don't trade. I was just curious on if these types of swings will still be around when the price gets into 6 figures. 
hg278kb comment this is what I'm afraid of. These exchanges that allow people to use crazy leverage multipliers are probably making a fortune when their customers get liquidated, right? If that's the case then wouldn't they never want to cease to exist? 
hg27kef comment No, they're generally not making a fortune from liquidations.  Why would they?

They generally charge a pretty standard fee per order, scaling with position size.  It's a profitable business if you have a good customer base, but there's nothing special about liquidations that earns them more.  Often, there's a small extra fee, but that usually goes into a fund to protect customers and the exchange. 
hg28qgr comment I'm not sure, I guess if the trader gets liquidated then they have to buy the bitcoin for the price, so I guess they are "stuck" with the bitcoin at that point.

A buddy of mine thinks this type of trading will cease to exist in its current form in the future as the price of bitcoin rises, and we will see "fractional" bitcoin trading start to take place, trading in satoshi's. 
hg2e000 comment Whether they are forced to buy or sell depends on whether they opened a short or long position, respectively.  But regardless, most exchanges match buyers & sellers, so they exchange isn't getting rich off liquidations.  They're just matching market participants and taking a small cut.

More than a decade later a bitcoin is $ 50+k and we keep talking about the most expensive pizza bought with 10k Bitcoins etc. In just a decade bitcoin’s market cap is approx a trillion dollars.  So I would end like a retard that anything is possible as it is still the wild Wild West of the gold rush when it comes to Bitcoin.

Sassaman's death coincided with the disappearance of Nakamoto.

hg25rba comment Maybe it wasn't a bug. But a feature. 
hg29njs comment Not to mention a Satoshi post **after** Len died but before Hal Finney died saying “I am not Dorian Nakamoto”. If a hacker got a hold of that account there is 0 to gain from saying that at all, compared to anything else. More likely that Hal felt bad for using the name of someone who lived a few blocks from him and wanted to take the heat off. 
hg2ath9 comment Hal was American and didn't use double spaces. Satoshi was British and used double spaces. 


Satoshi is AB, but most likely he talked to Finney about it and Finney must have mentioned his neighbor Nakamoto and they went with it. Satoshi in Japanese means "intelligence history" and Nakamoto means "central origin". So the perfect name for bitcoin.

q500x6 submission If Bitcoin gets adopted as day-to-day currency, are decreasing prices good for the economy? 
hg2krw7 comment I've written blog posts about this very topic before. Essentially an inflationary currency makes incentives products to be cheap, plastic and disposable. A deflationary currency incentives products to be expensive, metal and durable. Consumers are much more careful how they spend their money so they spend it on quality rather than quantity. 
hg28yv5 comment It would be good for some aspects of the economy. Not for others. 

(I am using this as a hypothetical; phones are pretty necessary and probably aren’t going anywhere) Does a 0.02 ₿ iPhone sound so appealing when that same amount of Bitcoin can buy 2 of them in 5 years? Hell no. So Apple would stand to lose billions in revenue, if not go out of business because nobody wants to spend that. 

Everything necessary to live would likely remain the same but everything else would die. Nobody would spend their hard earned Bitcoin on bullshit when sometime in the future it will add years to their working career. 

Now imagine a house. People need a place to live. In today’s world houses, depending on the market, see near 20% inflation YOY. In the Bitcoin economy it’s conceivable houses would deflate considerably, because getting **any** Bitcoin is better than none, and next year the amount of Bitcoin the house would sell for would less (because Bitcoin has more purchasing power). 

Now think of employment. Companies would likely have “reverse raises”. Of course the company wants to enjoy the fruits of greater Bitcoin purchasing power and they’d get there by paying less Bitcoin to employees compared to last year. Those on a fixed wage in Bitcoin, if not extremely valuable, would likely end up on the unemployment line in short order. Of course machines would do very well in this sort of situation. The automation revolution would likely occur faster in the Bitcoin economy because getting to the lowest cost with 24 hour production would be the make or break it for any company wanting to survive if it’s not an essential good. 

TLDR; necessities would do well; useless bullshit would die. Our economy is built up by a lot of useless bullshit; there would be a lot of pain the world over. 
hg2b2ks comment No.  Currency or money has been constantly evolving for thousands of years.  Bitcoin doesn’t fit with the current paradigm.  Just like credit cards wouldn’t work in the Wild West and goldbars wouldn’t work on the stock exchange.  It is unique and will find its own utility 
hg2d7w4 comment high and low prices aren't good or bad. they are just numbers. what matters for the economy is how wealthy people are, and how much stuff is being produced (goods and services) in the economy. money isn't the economy. 
hg2hja2 comment It wont be a problem. As long people can buy same amount of stuff and services with their salary everything is ok. It is only central banksters lie that numbers need to grow all the time. 
hg2dsk0 comment If thought about it seriously, I think currently it is a very large speculative bet that Bitcoin will be used for small  regular day to day trades like buying an apple . If today I sell an apple for 1 dollar in btc and and after that btc drops 30% in value and now it's worth 0.7 cents  I am at a loss of 0.3cents. now If a customer returns a product back to seller and now the price of btc is up 20% what will seller do return the amount of btc the customer paid or return the amount of btc that is worth 1 usd at that time. There is a huge macro and micro economics in play 
Currently companies and buisness accept btc because everyone gets excited and thrilled that they are accepting btc they are so cool they get into spotlight of news and articles and it gives them  a little edge our compitition
But once  everyone starts doing same thing then those buisnesses don't standout  anymore 
So i think just like gold btc will be used as an asset for current generation to tackle inflation and get loan from banks or or any other organisation 
hg2gmcc comment Yes, it's good for the economy by definition, since that would be a market chosen currency.  
Decreasing prices indeed make an incentive for savings on the consumer end, but that at the same time lowers the interest rate and enables more research, expansions etc, because the total cost on those stuff, including labor, will be cheaper. On that, more workers will get wealthier, and they will tend to get into the point of "waiting more years to buy even more" will have a decreasing effect.  
For example, take it to the extreme: Say you have 1000 bitcoins. Will you really wait a few years to buy a phone cuz it will be cheaper then? (You can change the phone with any good).

So yeah. People can have a low time preference, but we don't live forever. Our time preference, even decreasing ones, sooner or later will hit a floor.  
Even accounting for those who somehow will have an infenitely small time preference, in the end they are just abdicating of resources that can be then used by entrepreneurs, aka helping in lowering the interest rates.  
The resources will still be used in the end.

Another interesting point is that if goods will get cheaper as time goes by, so will the wages. But it will be ok.

q50qm3 submission What A Sore Loser Looks Like (Vitalik bashing Bitcoin adoption in El Salvador) 
hg3xfmn comment Well said, good points. Thanks for sharing this. 
hg2pge5 comment One of the biggest scammers in history. 
hg2lvfv comment Vitalik clearly gaslights to advantage the centralized project that he controls. After I heard him being an absolute weasel on the Lex Fridman podcast I wrote him off. He is a dishonest shill. 
hg3aric comment Yes, you are right, a guy who is a multi Billionaire and BTC investor since early 2010's is a sore loser. Just wanted to know what makes him a "loser"? He owns more BTC and done more for BTC adoption than 99.9% of people so I just don't get the hate.

hg3cjkm comment I also dont get the hate. Let this guy speak freely, god damnit. I mean, making a video in which I rant about someone ranting about something is as stupid as it can get.

What I would like to see is someone making a video about how Vitalik's claims are untrue. E.g. he claimed that giving people crypto that are not educated about it may lead to scams. How is that not true? He also said that noone should be forced to use crypto. Please elaborate how that is a wrong statement? What can be said is that the situation in El Salvador is not one where people are necessarily foced to use crypto. I agree with that and I think Vitalik overdid it right there. He also made some other bad claims, but also some that are true. I dont know why people get so upset with someone speaking freely about something and voicing his opinion if they view him as "trash" anyways.

As soon as someone needs to get personal to make a claim its game over anyway; if you cant win a "debate" by bringing up arguments but getting down to a personal level you lost.

q518mp submission Bitcoin taproot = Bitcoin halving? 
hg2rd34 comment The Halvening is far more powerful. 
hg36f8e comment No. Halvening is supply based, taproot would be demand based. 
hg2hwt1 comment Bitcoin ETF is probably the news most people with money are looking at right now, not Taproot.

Taproot is not hyped up, so I don't think most people are speculating based off of it. 99% of  crypto holders probably have no idea what Taproot even is.

However, Taproot will expand Bitcoin's long term value proposition as a platform for applications with Schnoor signatures.

When you think about it, Bitcoin has 3 value propositions:

1. Store of value
2. Payments
3. Smart Contracts

I'd say that Bitcoin has succeeded in finding a product/market fit as a store of value (Tesla, Microstragey, Square, etc...) and as cash (El Salvador). But not so much for smart contracts, which is largely due to technical limitations within the Bitcoin network. Taproot helps marginally increase the capability of smart contracts, so it could lead to more developers migrating over and developing applications for Bitcoin.

Keep your expectations in check though, because Taproot doesn't put layer 1 Bitcoin smart contracts on par with other shitcoins smart contracts, and probably never will. Miners would have to agree to a massive hardfork overhauling the network from the ground up and that's not likely ever going to happen. In order to become competitive with shitcoins, Bitcoin Script would have to be able to perform loops. And in order to perform loops, we would have to engineer a deterrent mechanism to prevent people from spamming the network with loops. 
hg32jpj comment “In order to become competitive with shitcoins….”

Stay away from it. It has less than nothing to do with actual Bitcoin and is designed to catch investors' attraction just to keep them in distance to **the 'killer investment' itself, which is and will remain Bitcoin.**

Especially this 'future etf' shit brings some flaws which no sane person would expose themselves to. Just deep dive into it and see for yourself.

hg2oe7a comment "Put in the money you can't afford to lose" anon on Bitcoin 
hg2uxl7 comment No offense, but if you're in this as an alternative to stocks, then you don't fully understand bitcoin. This is not just an investment. It is a revolutionary hybrid of gold and digital currency. The long term returns are great, sure, but it's about more than the fiat value. It's a super neat piece of technology that is already starting to show it's worth in places like El Salvador and Nigeria. I'm not going to try to stop you from selling down the line, but unless I need the cash, I don't plan on selling, ever. It's less like an investment and more like an emergency fund for me. If I need it, I can sell it. If I don't, then I'll be ready if bitcoin reaches mass adoption (and with El Salvador, it has already begun). 
hg2qhdg comment The catch is that you need patience, understanding, and an iron stomach. Bitcoin rewards long-term holders, but it seems almost like it was designed to burn people who are just in it for a short-term profit.

Bitcoin is still very risky to the wrong kind of person...

The period about 1\~2 years after a Halvening—in other words, **right now**—is the most dangerous time to speculate on Bitcoin for a short-term investor. No one knows exactly how high the peak will be this time, or when the bull run will end, but one thing is for certain: the peak of every Halvening cycle is followed by a deadly drop on the other side. And when it comes, it will come fast.

In the coming 3\~6 months, many people will lose their fortunes because they hear about Bitcoin in the media, when hype has risen to a fervent pitch, and they think it's a sure thing. They get in, only to be immediately burned by a gut-wrenching 80% drop. Many will sell at a big loss for fear of losing it all. ^(And then tell everyone Bitcoin is a scam...)

Don't blindly invest in something you don't understand!

Bitcoin is just about the surest bet I've ever seen, but you have to understand the Halvening cycle and what causes it. Once you do, you'll realize that you need to invest with your eyes on the **next cycle**, not this one.

Few people have the patience to hold 4\~8 years, nor the stomach to shrug off 80% drops. 
hg2s9fy comment > but I haven't found any other better investment option.

Me neither. Seems to be the best.

Of course it can go down 80% in a couple of months.

But after learning about Bitcoin, I find it hard not to invest in it for the long term.

hg2nktu comment It’s the difference in the sell/buy spread. 250 sounds about right for Bitcoin. 
If you want to market buy, then you are willing to go ‘up to’ the next person who is trying to sell And vise versa on a sell. This is ultimately why a price raises in value, or drops in value. The more people that say ‘fuxk it, buy buy buy’ will drive the price up because you are chasing up to the sellers. And once again, the opposite is true. if more people are saying sell sell sell, then you are chasing down to the buyers. 
hg2q2a1 comment It's because they want to rip you off. 
hg2mgos comment [deleted] 
hg3ae7k comment Some people have told you this is due to the spread (the difference between the lowest offered buying price and highest offered selling price), but that's not true. If you look at Coinbase's order book, you can see that the spread is <$10:

[https://pro.coinbase.com/trade/BTC-USD](https://pro.coinbase.com/trade/BTC-USD)

The real reason why the price changes like that is because Coinbase is charging you a fee and masking that fact by hiding it in the buy/sell price. You are not trading against the best offer; you are trading against Coinbase itself. Coinbase is setting the prices you see. That's why everyone recommends using Coinbase pro - the retail app will bleed you empty with fees. 
hg2mpz5 comment using cb pro? 
hg2pqwi comment apart from limit buy/sell, which has its limits :) you can keep it at a minimum by trading in the highest volume pair, (usually btc/usdt).

i have not used coinbase, but if i had that much slippage/spread in my trades i would be looking elsewhere. thats half a percent each way, 1 percent per profitable trade, plus fees. 
hg2q8uy comment You can do limit orders, but I'd also recommend moving away from Coinbase.

Eventually, you'll need customer support. And when that happens, you'll be left waiting for weeks while your money is at stake.

q52vuq submission DCA or Lump Sum? 
hg2s83y comment lump sum = higher expected value, higher variance  

DCA (averaging) = lower variance, lower expected value  

The two main questions you have to ask yourself: can you stomach a drop down to 40k, 30k or something like that the day after you bought? And are you comfortable with holding such a large sum in bitcoin in the first place (meaning, have you got a hardware wallet, have you done a proper backup, did you test your backup, do you know what to do if your device bricks, do you understand what a seed phrase is etc etc).  

If the answer to both question is a yes, then you might consider lump sum. Either way, it doesn't matter that much either.  

One argument in favour of DCA beyond pure EV is that it gives you a bit of time to get accustomed to bitcoin storage/transactions before jumping in with larger amounts.  

This is all under assumption that you can stomach losing all your money completely and your life will still be fine. Don't invest what you cannot afford to lose and all that. 
hg2s8en comment Statistically, lump sum beats DCA.  That's just an average, though, and it assumes a decent time horizon.  If your goals are long term, buy early, walk away, and enjoy doing something you like.  Don't sweat the short term volatility. 
hg2tpmj comment Lump sum at the ATL is the best :)

But it's impossible to know when that will happen (and probably it already happened), so to average out you can DCA.

Also, with DCA you can do it forever.

Of course, if you happen to have a lot of money right now, and Bitcoin price goes up in the future, lump sum is better.

But there's no way to know. 
hg2ub8y comment If you do lump sum and it dips to 20k next week how will you feel? If you DCA and it blasts to 120k next week how will you feel? Those emotions will give you your answer which will probably be somewhere in the middle. For reference I DCAed and have less than half the BTC I would have had if I had done lump sum. Happened to be DCAing during a blastoff. 
hg2uxdo comment Start with a lump sum to secure a good position, then DCA. 

Like .26 of a coin 
hg2w3h7 comment Can you afford to lose it, in the worst case? Do you have a large enough buffer in cash / lower risk investments?

In the long term, it probably doesn't matter, unless you spread out your investments over a year or so. Looking ten years from now, BTC could go sky high, or dwindle to a low value (I don't believe in zero).

My own personal rule is that I put in 10% of what I can afford to save in BTC, 40% in other investments, and 50% in my savings account. The BTC is for the long term, the other investments for the mid term, and my savings for things like replacing my car, housing improvements, vacations, etc.

(I don't rebalance, so the percentages will deviate from what I put in them over time) 
hg2wwpe comment Just go 50/50 lump/dca 
hg2ymwf comment Huge potential to lump sum right now if you can leave it for at least 4 years.

BUT DCA is the same choice. You put in 10 percent next day/week/month when you buy another 10 percent either:

- price has gone down and you got a discount
- price has gone up and you can celebrate that your previous investment is performing 
hg38blm comment you could buy 0.36btc now for $20k so you have a nice 0.5btc .. put it on a hardware wallet. then you could start dca’ing the other $10k.

*not financial advice* 
hg3a6j3 comment DCA definently works better in reality, because it works every time.

q52zbc submission Price of the Coin 
hg2t852 comment 
>Each time a person is buying and another person is selling. To buy a coin one must sell that coin too and vice versa

If there's no seller at $55,000 buyers have to offer more, like $56k

If there's no buyers willing to pay more than $50k, sellers have to offer Bitcoin for $49k.

It's just a waiting "game". The one (buyer or seller) with high time preference has to change the price to attack someone to do the exchange with.

Many HODLers are willing to sell a part of their stack a way above $100,000. They have a low time preference and will become sellers ONLY when buyers will be willing to pay these prices. 
hg2td2p comment Supply and demand. Much the same as how the share market works. If buyers outweigh sellers then the price goes up and vice versa 
hg2st7l comment Each exchange has a sell and buy order book with sell and buy orders at different prices.

Whenever they find someone that wants to buy or sell, they check the order book and make the transaction if there's something available.

The listed price is based on the recent transactions 
hg2suzg comment Bitcoin HODLERS buy them and put them in cold storage removing them from online exchanges and decreasing supply. 
hg2svj0 comment Maybe this helps:
https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100314/why-do-bitcoins-have-value.asp 
hg2u9e7 comment Sellers post offers. Buyers post bids. If the orders match, a transaction is processed. The price agreed by buyer and seller is the price of Bitcoin at that exchange for that moment, until the next transaction  

The price goes up when buyers choose to bid higher prices. The price goes down when sellers choose to offer lower prices 
hg4ba7d comment It's a very basic question that should be understood before making ANY investment.

Is there anybody here who actually understands why Bitcoin "goes up"? It's not because of scarcity. So much for HODL.

q53nbu submission Things that don’t make sense to me that I’d like answered before I dip my feet in (valuations of Bitcoin affiliated companies) 
hg30598 comment 1) Marathon is a bitcoin miner.  They mint bitcoin - 340 new coins in September - and they're expanding their hash rate aggressively with a $100M purchase order for top-of-the-line S19 pro ASICs (the largest PO for bitmain to date). 

2) Investors in Marathon (I am one) want MARA to hold the bitcoin not sell it, because the entire point of the investment is to get exposure to bitcoin's upside.

Personally my hope is to eventually get paid dividends in bitcoin or, possibly, for MARA to use the BTC to stake up-and-coming companies developing for the bitcoin blockchain. 
hg2xhvl comment 1. At 500,000 a coin it hits a bit over the 10 trillion market cap, which is what gold is about at. Many analysts believe bitcoin is eating golds market cap so possibly this.

2. Your asset in this instance (Bitcoin) is too valuable to sell because it continues to appreciate at a very fast rate. This (in theory) will provide enough return to pay back the initial loan by just borrowing against another collateralized loan in the future when bitcoin is at a higher valuation. 
hg31ya7 comment "Market is forward looking", "collaterized credit revolver"..

Hi, try reading the bitcoin white paper. Things won't make sense until you get it. Valuation metrics and traditional financial literacy (lol) don't apply here. Sorry.

Also buying bitcoin related companies or bitcoin IOUs is kinda dumb. You get the same exposure as buying bitcoin but you get execution risk and you pay a premium on top. 
Like bitcoin could be sailing and the CEO at MARA could turn out to be a baby eating cannibal or get their reserve raided, down goes your equity.
Conversely, Bitcoin drops, MARA drops faster.

You can add alerts in all different currencies that are supported within the app. This will be added to the portfolio as well, so that you can change the currency of the average cost instead of only the selected currency.  
  
For now it´s only top 25 coins but if everything goes as expected I will shortly add another 100-200 coins.

q53y5x submission How To Trust Yourself You Make the Right Decision When Buying Bitcoin. The secret lies in your vision of the goals of Bitcoin. 
hg2z6qg comment More and more people understand that something incredible is happening with Bitcoin. This incredible monetary revolution continues to grow block by block. Banks are now coming into this world in fear of being left behind.

George Soros himself just bought Bitcoin, just in case as they say... Gold is clearly no longer a dream for people even when facing great monetary inflation.

After reading the Bitcoin white paper and various books and articles, many people are saying that they have to act. However, when it comes to buying Bitcoin, many fail to take action, thinking: what if the price of Bitcoin drops after I buy it?

Since Bitcoin's volatility is a feature, not a bug, it is a very real possibility. Bitcoin's price may fall in the short term, but that's when you need to stick to Bitcoin's long-term goals.

A monetary revolution like Bitcoin takes time.

When buying Bitcoin, you need to have at least 5 or 10 years ahead of you, not the next week. Once you understand this, you won't hesitate to take action.

You will detach yourself from the short-term price of Bitcoin since the goals are much further away. And most importantly, you will become a no matter what HODLer, because patience is the key with Bitcoin. 
hg308wt comment tldr; A good idea without action is worthless. It's what you do with your good idea that counts. Wanting to embrace the Bitcoin revolution is a great idea, but without taking action, it’s worthless. Buy Bitcoin and become a Bitcoin HODLer no matter what, ready to hold your positions for 5, 10, 15 years.

hg3246x comment Comparison to the tulip bubble is never meant to be literal. It’s never been about the product. It’s about human psychology - the herd behaviour and FOMO.

hg8nk8f comment > It’s about human psychology - the herd behaviour and FOMO

Tulipmania is just a parable for humans behavior related to excessive speculation. Yeah, this's about psychology - I'm with you, man!

But indeed, comparing Cryptocurrency hype (Bitcoin) with Tulipmania (Tulips' hype) is relatively less precise. Bitcoin is part of technology on a global scale, has utility in a vital sector, and is useable almost by everyone. IMHO

*Out of topic!* I read this article in a different source (Cointelegraph) then realized that the writer is Jonathan Libby, CEO of Steady State Finance. Steady State is a DeFi insurer that offers a dynamic interplay between indexed coverage pools, automated claims, objective risk analysis, and liquid secondary markets. I often watch Jon on their YouTube live, and I know right about Jon's view about crypto, blockchain, and DeFi. So, I'm not surprised by the article above. I *97.35%* agree with Jon Libby's article.

q54qjc submission Most significant thing about El Salvador making BTC legal tender 
hg38arf comment This could happen regardless of legal tender status.  


For most of the world, Bitcoin can be used without restriction. And in the places where there are restrictions, Bitcoin can prevail anyway because it's naturally censorship-resistant.  


All it takes is people willing to transact in Bitcoin. That's it.  


The Bitcoin Law in El Salvador simply allocates government funds toward Bitcoin infrastructure. You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink. It's still on the people themselves to actually decide to use Bitcoin instead of fiat.

hg39oyg comment I don't know. I think a government supporting BTC is important.

Is there any evidence currently of something like an entire ecosystem wherein BTC is used without being converted to fiat?

I think El Salvador's governmental support would be the swiftest way of establishing a system where BTC continues to circulate or be held as savings without ever reaching an exchange. But if you know of that happening already, tell me where that is happening.

El Salvador's yearly (in 2018) GDP was in excess of 50 billion dollars -- that is not the same thing as all the currency in El Salvador, it should be much less -- and if that amount was tied up in BTC (I suspect that is not likely soon) it is a very significant amount of total BTC. Just one small country. It actually would not take too many El Salvador-sized countries to soak up all BTC. (In theory.)

Definitely the trend is for more and more BTC to become unavailable to exchanges -- they tend to move from the hands of traders to the hands of holders, kind of like by definition,

Of course that's an opportunity for me to spread a little knowledge and educate, but there's absolutely going to be people that just want the fiat, as that's what their original ask was (and El Salvador showed us this)... so my question to you guys is:

q54vj1 submission The best Bitcoin financial planning for any 30-35 year old. 
hg388yr comment > Buy $500 worth of bitcoin every month, aiming for one bitcoin.

$500 is about 0.01 a month right now. That means you would need 100 months to reach 1 Bitcoin. That's about 8 years.

> By 2031 the price would be $1m per coin

If that happens, then the monthly $500 would buy you a lot less than 0.01 per month. That would mean you would not get to 1 Bitcoin in 10 years.

> deposit 0.1 coin with 10 different institutions to get 5% APY, live on that $50,000 per year zero risk zero stress.

Since you won't have 1 Bitcoin, you won't be able to get that return.

Also, the rates in 10 years are probably not going to be 5%.

Not having an expensive living standard also helps.

I think it also depends on your mindset. Do you need to show people you are rich? Then you will have problems with saving up money in Bitcoin.

I could afford more rent and a bigger apartment, but I just don't want to spend over 1200$ monthly rent only to have a bit more room for me alone.

I just want to buy myself a nice apartment in maybe 8-10 years without debt, and I think bitcoin will make it possible.

Don’t be the “when lambo” or “to the moon” ape.  You appear to be better than that with your planning so maybe a non issue.  Be patient and know governments will never stop printing and the bitcoin community will keep growing.  And when you hit the amount of bitcoin that makes you feel financially free (different for everyone obviously) get a job you enjoy and don’t spend your Bitcoin. 
q554hq submission How bad are biased dice for seed word generation 
hg3n3z0 comment You can use a biased instrument to get truly unbiased randomness. For instance, get a single die and throw it twice. If the second result was greater than the first, you get a '1'. If it was less than you get a '0'. If they were the same you get nothing, so start again. Repeat this until you have a sequence as long as required. This sequence of 0s and 1s is random and both results have a 50% probability, no matter how biased the die is. 
hg36zj0 comment You can always use your dice to add entropy to the Coldcard's RNG.  You don't have to exclusively use dice entropy. 
hg3hkmy comment You only need one die. 
hg3o91g comment it would be better if you relied on the cold card to generate a seed for you. you are relying on it to keep your private keys safe anyway. you have to trust it. 
hgahe2y comment Assuming your die *is* perfectly fair, what is the expected number of throws that you'd need in order to generate a random 256-bit string using this scheme? Is it just 256×2/(5/6)=614.4? The 5/6 is the probability of throwing two different numbers (again, assuming the die is actually fair). Obviously, the expected number of throws only increases as the die gets less fair. 
hg3v2ki comment Trust, but verify.

No reason to trust "default" seeds.  Much better to generate your own.

hg39iv2 comment If you’re investing in Bitcoin then it sounds like you’ve already decided? 
hg39v7j comment Buy BTC. Hold until retirement. 
hg3a3pd comment > Hey guys I have $6000 more to invest in bitcoin what coin should buy?

Obviously Bitcoin. 
hg3a29s comment I think OP is convinced that the word bitcoin is a synonym for the word cryptocurrency. My advice is to start to understand what you are talking about, and maybe deepen a little so at least if you have to invest 6k you’ll can do it in something that you understand. 
hg39uwy comment i think OP meant crypto not bitcoin
hope you know what you are doing 
hg39xe9 comment It's your choice 
hg3a662 comment You have 6000 to invest in btc but you asking what coin to buy? I'm confused... 
hg3a8bw comment Huh? 
hg3a9rv comment Buy 6K worth of Bitcoin that’s all you need. 
q55z3l submission I'm looking for an android BTC miner 
hg3bcat comment Every single one will be a SCAM. 

If you are looking to earn some Bitcoin, check microlancer or r/BitcoinJobs out.

You can also start mining shitcoins and get paid in Bitcoin, using Nicehash.

Or if you feel like it, **DYOR**, check r/BitcoinMining and get a proper miner. 
hg3ainq comment There are people out there with banks of dedicated processing units and sometimes even their own ‘power stations’, do you honestly think you can make much profit from a single phone? 
hg3lgry comment LMFAO 
hg6t3zn comment If you find any the. Don't forget to mention me in the post because I need it too. 
hg4grhf comment Hmm, this seems a bit nice idea sir, the portable and the cheaper one too. 
hg3c4gw comment Can’t exist from a technical perspective. 
hg3disv comment Lol, that's not possible. 
hg3f78b comment I mean, technically you can try to mine on any device, but you won't get any money from it unless it's an ASIC. 
hg3cpie comment You will pay much more in electricity than you make in btc. Though neither will be much.

You would do a lot better just buying it on an exchange.

q56nej submission What Bitcoin correction? BTC price holds $55K despite several bearish indicators 
hg3waas comment Technical Astronomy 
hg3hkiw comment tldr; Bitcoin price continues to rally despite Bollinger bands and Fear and Greed indicators pointing to an overheated rally. However, there's no way to know whether we're entering a large potential correction or a rally continuation. A correction will always come at some point, but how many weeks or months later?

hg3go2z comment I hope you have a Plan B. 
hg3hu04 comment Bold strategy Cotton.  Let’s see if it pays off 
hg3jv33 comment People are so greedy. Not long ago ETFs with 7% annual return were good. Now with bitcoin everyone wants to be a millionaire in 10 years.

To talk about just one flaw: You assume that you can buy BTC very cheap in the next years but expect a price of 1 Mio in 13 years... 
hg3heke comment Get rid of wife and kids. Success. 
hg3gu6h comment You can’t make life plans around risky presumptions… it seems to me like you should be looking into general financial advice rather than just hoping Bitcoin will solve all your troubles. 
hg3l9e3 comment BTW, consider sending your kids to a foreign country to study, like Germany. The credits transfer back to the US and lectures are in English (if so desired). US universities are collapsing, both in content and in idiotically astronomical tuition. Currently it's a total waste of money for parents with college-age kids.

EXCEPTION: a very-US-specific major, like law or medicine. 
hg3nrl0 comment A better plan would be to build a time machine and buy bitcoin at a cheaper price in the past. 
hg3ka3n comment 3 bitcoins, you just need 3.. 
hg3mpwi comment Makes no sense. You "only" need to accumulate an asset which.. according to your plan will massively appreciate in value over ten years.. over ten years.

So you _only_ need to put an ever increasing amount into this asset over ten years.

If your thesis is that bitcoin will appreciate around 20x in ten years you should mortgage your house and sell your kids into slavery today. You can buy them back with the insane proceeds when Bitcoin is a million per coin. 
q56vbv submission Andrew Yang Announces New Party, Supports Bitcoin 
hg3hkbi comment tldr; Andrew Yang, a former Presidential Candidate and member of the Democratic Party, has announced that he is starting a new political party called "The Forward Party." "Big proponent of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies generally - want to allow fiat prices to go down as they should as things get more efficient instead of assuming the inflation model," he said.

hg4gf83 comment Isn’t that the guy trying to give everyone money if they vote for him? 
hg3gr5e comment Bitcoin and ubi?  Seems counter to one another. 
hg3uh4r comment *lol ITT so many people who'd rather have the whole economic and political system collapse, than give the new guy / new party a chance. It can only be blue or red, nothing else. Look where it brought us! 
hg3wypm comment This guy gets it. All the bitcoin proponents will follow the move. 
hg3k4en comment UBI is coming whether you like it or not. Technology will displace millions from their jobs in the coming decade. Good that he supports Bitcoin 
hg3qqrr comment I'm all for yang and sander although I know they'll never win 
hg3ghbn comment This guy. 
Good ideas but too much dumb.

hg3hmgo comment They would have to report to the SEC right? 
hg3icui comment How would this be in their interest? If they didn’t buy the underlying then they are on the hook for all gains. Seems risky for little to no benefit to them 
hg3oy31 comment blockfi's etf isn't even going to invest in bitcoin but rather bitcoin futures contracts at the CME.

hg3pt0a comment Probably increase it. Many boomers with a lot of money but too dense to understand technology will see it as another way to make money. They don’t give a crap about how Bitcoin can change the global financial and economic landscape. Because boomers. 
hg3r7kk comment How does this affect BTC holders? Just the ETF people will have their stuff devalued. Owning the keys to BTC will be like owning actual gold bars? I’m probably wrong but correct me If so 
hg3v0e6 comment Yes. They have just introduced a short sell mechanism into BTC. 
hg4a695 comment The opposite 
hg3ig2a comment We're going to have to assume that the Bitcoin ETFs will do the same as what the gold ETFs have been doing: Selling hundreds of ***times*** more ounces of "paper gold" than their physical gold holdings -- suppressing the price of gold.  

The wise will also assume that at some point, the government will decide it "needs" to ***confiscate*** Bitcoins, for some bullshit excuse, but really because the fiat currency is collapsing and they'll need money with actual value to pay the bills (military, etc.)  They won't be able to confiscate Bitcoins in self-custody, but they will confiscate Bitcoins from ETFs. exchanges, and other custodial arrangements.  I'm pretty sure they won't be announcing the big BTC grab ahead of time. 
hg3htyd comment The same SEC that investigated Bernie Madoff and found no wrong-doing, yes. 
hg3tvp7 comment This makes the most sense from the perspective of an ETF.
1. They need a notional amount of BTC. Meaning their margin requirements are fractional to the capital they will be trading.
2. It's a fast track to get approved. There is no question of backing or audits of physical BTC. 
3. ETFs have done this for years. It's the blueprint for most major ETFs that tracks a commodity. Especially the leveraged ones. (See point 2)
4. Taxes and regulation fees are predetermined by existing rules. 
q575c7 submission It's time to finally stop worshiping Nayib Bukele. 
hg3q3g9 comment For once someone thought of doing something for animals, just as a mere gesture, and that needs to be criticized? That money is not enough to do much, just a token of what might be possible one day. Let them decide what is the most suitable gesture. 
hg3k1kp comment This shit happens in every country 

Let's stop using money because they use it to fund wars instead of housing all homeless people while we are at it 
hg3rq2n comment At least he is not using it to build a million dollar statue of himself 😂 
hg72qc9 comment You should not worship anyone period. 
hg3jceb comment [deleted] 
hg3or8c comment "I don't like what they spent their money on so I'm now against Nayib!!"

There's a special place in heaven for animal lovers and if you got a problem with them, you got a problem with me.  I  suggest you let that marinate! 
hg3yck9 comment And why should anyone care what you think?  Its not your Bitcoin. 
hg4q1qa comment show me a SINGLE POST of someone worshiping Bukele 
hg3jrxe comment Is there no other project which could bring money and jobs into the economy? Infrastructure, housing... or hospital... for humans, maybe?

I seriously doubt they have so much money that financing a public pet hospital is the wise decision here.

It truly feels like the "feel good" project for the masses to become more popular. 
hg3vqkv comment How did you assume I have something against animals from this post?  
Just saying public finances would be better spent elsewhere, vet clinic is something more suitable for the private sector.   


Is there any country where the government built vet clinics?

q577a4 submission Using Bitcoin's Network, Strike Users Can Send Any Currency... to Anyone... Across Borders... Without Banks (Anthony Pompliano explains how they do it in this short audio clip) 
hg4xw40 comment “Send any currency to anyone in the world completely for free, instantly”

I want Strike to go public so I can see their financials. How profitable are they? If I send money from the US to France, for example, Strike handles it but behind the scenes they take my dollars and give someone else Euros. With fluctuations in exchange rates between dollars and euros and dollars and Bitcoin and euros and Bitcoin they incur costs. I wonder what they do to handle this.

q57br5 submission Edward Snowden Calls CBDCs 'Cryptofascist Currency' — 'Closer to Being a Perversion of Cryptocurrency' – Economics Bitcoin News 
hg3it1p comment The bitcoin (dot) com domain is owned by a convicted felon who describes himself as "Bitcoin Jesus" and has a long history of unscrupulous behavior. From [vouching for MtGox solvency before it collapsed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/77vrek/roger_ver_on_mtgox_bitcoin_exchange_for_the/), to promoting Craig Wright [as if he were Satoshi Nakamoto](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/776fim/funny_how_all_the_criminals_and_fraudsters_in/), the owner acquired the "r / btc" subreddit and packed its mod team with paid employees to spread divisive misinformation about the bitcoin protocol and various individuals in the bitcoin space, including this subreddit as a whole. He has also leveraged the domain and subreddit to promote an impostor altcoin to unsuspecting newcomers as if it were actually Bitcoin. As such, the domain is considered malicious, and the r/Bitcoin mod team kindly asks that readers seek out credible sources to post instead.

hg3pj4n comment tldr; NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden has called central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) a "cryptofascist currency" and a "perversion of cryptocurrency" and "an evil twin entered into the ledgers on Opposite Day." Snowden added that CBDCs are "expressly designed to deny its users the basic ownership of their money and to install the State at the mediating center of every transaction."

hg3kcor comment Trust me. I’ve been doing Bitcoin since the beginning. I created my own advanced analysis tools. The price with either go up or down or sideways in the near future. 
hg3s290 comment My prediction is that Bitcoin will reach the price of 60k right after you panic sell, which in turn, will cause you to regret all your life choices. 
hg3kunq comment It’ll go up. It’ll go down. If you are looking to sell then you miss the point of HODLING. 
hg3k6op comment You had your chance to sell at 56k and you didn’t…and now you want to know if it will hit 60k soon?

😭😭 this post doesn’t even make sense 
hg3z01s comment The WORLD is in a bubble and BTC is the pin. 
hg3s0bx comment I’ve being doing it longer. NGU 
hg3knjr comment Those are the theoretical  possibilities.

But with technical analysis and looking at the news, which is more likely to happen? everything happens for a reason right? 
hg3ka9g comment because I believe it will go much higher. 
hg3m5v8 comment Yes, but we don’t know what reason is for next move. Imagine, it will go to 20 or 10, wouldn’t your next move is to buy more?

So, if it’s goes up, wait for the next question, if it’s go down, add more. 

Of course if you are long-term, otherwise, it is years to get in investment world.
