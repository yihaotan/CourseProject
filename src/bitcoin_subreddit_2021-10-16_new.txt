q90r8r submission Cashing in BTC/Coinbase - numbers don't add up 
hgt08hl comment It‚Äôs what‚Äôs called the spread. You generally pay more when buying and get less when selling. Something to do with the average across exchanges or something, I‚Äôm not entirely sure how it‚Äôs calculated. 
hgt6jg5 comment Use Coinbase Pro. Regular Coinbase charges huge fees and spreads. Coinbase Pro is only like 0.25% fee 
hgszs7o comment Sell it on Coinbase pro. Much lower fee and no spread. 
hgt2kzm comment 1 is mark price, other is in their terms and contract, stating they will go slightly lower to ensure they don't get screwed on the volatility 
hgsyl5d comment "numbers on coinbase". can you be more specific? screenshots perhaps?  

you realize that coinbase has multiple platforms for buying and selling?  one is a public live exchange called coinbase pro. another is a money changer service where they charge arbitrary spreads and fees. and they even have an OTC desk for private trades. 
hgszvlz comment Forgive my ignorance,  but what is the difference between coinbase and coinbase pro? 
hgsyspi comment I won't put any screenshots on here, but the price of BTC in my portfolio and on the selling page is not the same. 
hgt01gv comment Pro is just the trading platform. Use the same login as regular Coinbase. 
hgt3mme comment Yup.  That's the spread.

Start using Coinbase Pro unless you just like donating money to Coinbase.

hgt48yi comment It will shoot to 100K 
hgt51zf comment You should do it. Sell BTC (the best money in the world) for USD (shit money) and then hold on to your USD and hope that you can buy BTC at a lower USD valuation. It's not like TONS of people haven't tried this before--all of them end up with way less BTC.

So go ahead and try. :)

hgt4261 comment tldr; Bitcoin has surpassed the psychologically important US$60,000 mark for the first time in half a year and is now worth around US$62,266. This comes amid expectations that the SEC could approve the first Bitcoin ETF in the US next week. However, should the SEC decide not to approve the ProShares Bitcoin ETF, an expert from CNBC expects the Bitcoin to fall sharply.

If you imagined the future 50 years ago it was electric cars, space travel, touch screens and instant video communication with anyone around the world. I guess finance didn‚Äôt make it to the visualization since it‚Äôs not so inspirational but when you think, does the financial system of the past fit into the future? Nope, Bitcoin is right at home in that imagined and now turning real future.

q91qg9 submission I Saw This And Thought Of You XXX 
q91r9a submission Bitcoin will lead to to the re- definition of‚Ä¶ country, tax, possession, law, protection, ownership, responsibility, etc‚Ä¶ 
hgtfvqt comment Agreed.

For example, I do not like owning physical assets anymore, such as real estate, and not even fiat money under the custody of a bank, because it does not feel like real ownership.

Furthermore, country borders barely exist for Bitcoin, and national laws look quite irrelevant. National governments make a lot of noise for nothing.

In what sense do they even hold jurisdiction over these things? I consider their attitude to be futile, arrogant, and outright presumptuous. 
hgt77in comment bitcoin has already redefined ownership. never before has a person been able to possess, transport, and control an asset which exists only in his mind. nobody has experienced ownership this certain, defensible and absolute.  bitcoin guarantees the most basic of all human rights: the right to own your self, your destiny, and the products of your labor. 
hgu41wv comment Outside of money. Bitcoin leads to global re- definition of chat msg, social media, web, ISP/mesh, communications, identities, voting, governance, audits, commerce.

Which are also impactful to laws, borderlines, & behaviors that you list. 
hgt9r06 comment > ...only in his mind...

What?  

Is the blockchain not public?  Are there not copies all over the globe? 
hgtwhe8 comment "only in his mind" I understand you mean the keys you hold in your mind, which can unlock a fortune without physical dependence on the asset.

I'll assume due to downvotes and answers, most people misunderstood you, and thought that "in his mind" meant something non-existent and useless. 
hgt9jer comment Fuk off bot 
hgtdfsv comment are you that dumb? (don't answer that.

2.	Write down your seed phrase on paper, laminate them, and put in capsules
3.	Keep one at home and the others wherever you trust outside your home <‚Äî fire insurance
4.	Use a passphrase you can memorize easily <‚Äî 5 finger discount insurance

You can probably make 8 of these for the price of one Blockplate + punch, and you‚Äôll skip the headaches of trying to hand punch steel.

hgtcir4 comment ecstatic? nonsense. these are purely technical moves. all within formerly created ranges.   

"manipulated downward"? you don't know wtf you're talking about.  all price action is "manipulation" of one sort of another. are you alleging some illegal behavior? or unethical? what exactly? draw a picture for us.  

the price going down when you think it should go up isn't "manipulation". but that I guarantee is as far as you can define it. 
hgtjkdv comment i suppose its possible these futures etf's could undermine the entire government cuz overtime they will be shown to be allowed cheaters big money with these new abilities will be like bullies in the schoolyard

"If we do this, we'd follow our hardware wallet model: build in the open in collaboration with the community," Dorsey said in a tweet. He added that silicon design or chip design is too concentrated into a few companies, leading to supply constraints.

hgunjnp comment Take a step back and evaluate his actions in btc.. compare that to trumps actions?  Who seems like they actually support democracy and decentralization.. 
hguoc17 comment What is your derangement with Trump? Another boy crush you can't get him out of your mind? I did not mention him or even think of him.  And for your point. Sure. Take money over free uncensored speech. Smart move. You used the correct word 'seems'. Fools will follow. 
hguq82u comment Well, twitter famously "censored" Trump.. I'm not sure that was the huge leap you are making it out to be.

As to your other points.. im not sure i follow either.  Yes,  i did use seems as neither of us can know the true intentions of Jack (nor anyone)... 

Also,  free speech does not mean uncensored.  In America we have a long complicated history with free speech, censoring misinformation and propaganda has been upheld by the courts many many times.  If you want to argue on a purely theoretical basis, you will also find most philosophers agree there are necessary limits on free speech.  Incitement towards violence,  libel,  intolerance,  etc are commonly unprotected speech. 
q92t76 submission Anyone do direct deposit with Strike for their paycheck? 
hgtdf3t comment Set it up the day it became available. Hopefully the paycheck after next it will be good to go. Was already doing this with Cash App so I can still accumulate in the meantime but this was a no brainer really.

Edit: should have read the entire post my bad. No I am not doing 100% of my check because taxes. I‚Äôd rather spend fiat for bills and dump money into Bitcoin after. 

Maybe this will change in the future. 
hgu3xg1 comment Man, we need strike in EU and U.K.! 
hgu28ba comment When will ADP, Paychex, paylocity and other payroll service firms catch up?  They should already have these options integrated somehow via a partnership with Binance, Coinbase or other.

This looks super fascinating to me, just now learning this exists, excited to fall into the research rabbit hole tonight. 
hgtcwxj comment I did it and it worked flawlessly. I have just set a static dollar amount per paycheck going to Strike with 100% conversion. It was essentially free. I was also able to transfer to cold storage immediately. That‚Äôs the only missing convenience here; they should emulated Swan Bitcoin and allow auto transfers either to a single address or a derived list of addresses from zpub.

q93ht0 submission Jack Dorsey's Square Considers Building A Global Bitcoin Mining System 
hgtlwrh comment tldr; Square CEO Jack Dorsey has announced that his company will start building consumer-friendly mining machines to be used by the general population. Dorsey claims that mining needs to be more distributed in order to maintain the security of the Bitcoin network over time. The company will use custom silicon and open-source development to lower the barrier to mining.

q94l8a submission BTC Futures ETF explained 
hgtz1wt comment A future ETF. What a shitshow. They know if they approved an asset-backed quality bitcoin etf, bitcoin would soar like hell bringing bitcoin to $200k-$400k in a matter of weeks. 

And as you can certainly imagine there are some reasons this is not wanted:

**1) Banksters haven't yet accumulated enough**

**2) Too many unknown whales outthere**

**3) Way too many retail investors with way too much wealth in the end.**


The products getting approval now have nothing to do with actual bitcoins. They come with heavy [downsides](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/q4hpcy/z/hg0jm11)  I strongly recommend to look into. In fact to me it's quite obvious. Their sole purpose of being created and sold is keeping the crowd as far as possible away from **the actual investment of the millennium, Bitcoin itself**. And while everybody institutional is busy overcoming the remaining hurdles and getting into this derivate shit for their average Joe customers, in the background the privileged quietly and secretly keep stacking actual Bitcoin for highly undervalued prices. Until their greed is satisfied (which will never be) and the future etf bubble of hope pops as well, revealing bitcoins true price in some years. Which will be a lot higher then they'll in between pretend it to be.

This is why I won't stop calling them out. They won't get away with this. They won't fool millions of people out of real bitcoin into some cowshitvalued investment piece of crap. Remember my words. Fiat money's time is running out. And all of these fraudy banksters will fuckin go down with it. Remember my words.

*People don't be stupid! Keep stacking real bitcoins. And hodl. Sure, they'll fight us...but in the end we'll win* 
hgupknr comment Was also wondering why would they not approve a regular ETF?  To not make it accessible and suppress price makes sense

There are bitcoin ETF's you can hold in your TFSA. 
hgtuz5x comment It would be taxable

hgtwz35 comment tax-free: ATM(with a limit of 980/day) or bisq

taxed: crypto app work good, they transfer to your bank account 
hgu6ueu comment Do you really think that this money will be earning you more in a tax-free savings account? 

Keep in mind that your currency is inflating away at record rates. It's the currency that's the problem, not the type of account you're sticking it in. 
hgtrpqi comment This is correct. 
hgudq2r comment Pretty much the same applies to most other countries in the world. So don't expect that to change anytime soon. 
hgtwk0n comment Are you sure celcius work in canada ? 
hgw1pu6 comment I don‚Äôt have any real issues with that. But the policy that trading crypto for crypto is a taxable event is the real problem. 
q94qoe submission Stress induced by BTC profits ? 
hgttrpa comment So this might be oftopic for the bitcoin forum but..

Might have nothing to do with bitcoin at all. You see this all the time in "regular investing ". People are "happy " and focused on investing (might be anything really), then when they start making money a anxiety creeps in and they become numb/sad/depressed. Most common is it for people that become rich very fast.

Take a while and think through if you really are happy or if it something else you need to fix in your life. Maybe you have focused your happiness on bitcoin and "will be truly happy when number x is reached", then when number x is reached nothing changes other than that you loose your tool to combat that you are lacking something (else) in life. 
hgtqp9y comment If not already, ensure your BTC is safely held in a secure non-custodial wallet.  Then you could choose to just put it away not worrying about it.  Go focus on more important things in life and if you want check up on it every couple years. 
hgts6nx comment Take a little bit out and buy yourself something nice. Then buy the next dip.

That always make it less stressful for me. 
hgtx3ei comment Put it deep in cold storage with multi sig and just smile every time you hear people bitch about inflation or the rising cost of living, knowing that you are all good. 
hgu3l7l comment So I have 2 diverging tips:

- Try to forget about it. Enjoy your life like nothing.

- Learn as much as you can about Bitcoin. There is always room to aquire knowledge in this topic. This is personally what made me comfortable with my "investment" (which I don't treat as an investment anymore). I'm at a point where I start not to care about bitcoin price, only about how much sats I own. This also helps with "volatility". 
hgtss0g comment Taxes, its always the taxes. 
hgu2ppe comment Because it's extremely stressful to straddle the world when you have to decide between fulfilling current desires and future desires - and none of those future outcomes are really a given, so you have to constantly weigh things in your mind. 

Of course you have to do what helps you sleep best at night, but find your risk level and just accept it I would say. 
hgui1ik comment >I don't have fancy taste, except a nice whisky from time to time.

[https://liquorverse.com/](https://liquorverse.com/) accepts bitcoin. 
hgtpk1e comment Bro take profits. Nothing is ever enough and the volatility is only fun when you have used enough profits to enjoy life throughout your investing career. 
hgtsovk comment enjoy it. you can relax when you die. 
q94rus submission People won't even be talking about Bitcoin in the future, and here's why: 
hgtpw9y comment The title had some hope that you knew wtf you were talking about, but then you jumped the shark.  

The "price" is measured in what you can buy with it.  Why are dollars even part of the equation? Do you think dollars are a permanent part of our reality for some reason? Because govt said so?

hgvls0f comment Don't get me wrong, I do all my browsing over Tor and run a few nodes myself. But I don't see the point of running a Bitcoin node over Tor. It's slower, takes more resources, encrypts duplicated publicly available information, and doesn't hide that you are running a node.

hgu6cdi comment 
I‚Äôve been on a mission recently, trying to orange pill a friend who is an economist. She now says there‚Äôs only one big hurdle left for her before she can grasp the greatness of btc: 
In a btc world, governments wouldn‚Äôt have the ability to ‚Äùstimulate‚Äù / manipulate the economy of the country and its currency in various ways. This could lead to ‚Äùdangerous scenarios‚Äù. To which I respond that maybe it‚Äôs the other way around etc etc. She gets angry, says I use words in the wrong way, that I don‚Äôt understand how the world economy works (that is true) etc.
So: What would be some good sources for us both to read up on this particular issue; what negative implications, if any,  could there be, in a hyperbitcoinized future, from the fact that governments of the world  lose some of their ‚Äùtools‚Äù (‚Äùprinting money‚Äù) etc?

hgurrpr comment yes please 
hgv9otb comment I wish you good luck with your projects! I really like the approach of experimenting as soon as possible. 

About your latest project If I can advise you something for the beginning, I think you should try to work on a good "how to" landing page describing what the project is in a simple way. Maybe some kind of infographic?  This shouldn't be much effort but will help to convert visitors into users. 
hgvc05r comment Let‚Äôs do this!! 
hgvpm5v comment I love the way its going now keep on doin what u do man cheers. 
hgw6ox7 comment Small tips are the gateway to larger p2p transactions. Once people become comfortable with sending small amounts of crypto (and used to the ins and outs), you can count the days until they use it for something more substantial.

q96myc submission Bitcoin is Above $62K, What is Happening? 
hgu1ueu comment People buying Bitcoin, perhaps? 
hgu2g8n comment tldr; Bitcoin breached the $60,000 mark for the first time since April on Friday, October 15. This comes amid growing optimism that US regulators will greenlight the first US futures exchange-traded fund for the cryptocurrency. Reports suggest that ‚Äúone-third of the bitcoin hashrate now sits in US borders.‚Äù

hgu3z10 comment "NewziTech¬†reported, on October 5, Bitcoin was to cross the $50K mark and, now after 10 days, it has breached the $60K in just 10 days. This represents an 80% gain in the last 10 days."


How did they get that 80% gain in the last 10 days number? 
hgu69tq comment There's speculation that a Bitcoin ETF ( BITO ) may get approved by the sec and if the ETF does become available it means crypto is here to stay. then many more banks and investment funds will likely start pouring large amounts of money into Bitcoin and probably other cryptos bringing a whole new class of investors to Bitcoin ( more whales ). Bank of America recently started a crypto research team to look more in depth at crypto currency according to a news report. It's possible BITO by proshares could begin trading Monday 10/18/2021 or some time the week of 10/18/21 according to a CNBC report. 
hgu2ezt comment Or not selling 
hgu5gk5 comment No 
hgu67bi comment They flipped the numbers. It's the opposite. It's 20% not 80%. 
q96psb submission ‚ÄòThank God for Bitcoin,‚Äô Cynthia Lummis says on US debt limit raise 
hgu2g67 comment tldr; US Senator Cynthia Lummis said that Bitcoin should be there to allow people to save in the event the government fails. She added that Bitcoin transcends the "irresponsibility of governments, including our own" and is a "blessing of God". The senator is known for accumulating significant amounts of Bitcoin, with one of her latest purchases worth $50,000 to $100,000.

hgu30do comment a crystallized embodiment of the very principle of human rights itself. god given, if anything ever was.

hgujvxq comment Cynthia is right on this time around 
q96vp2 submission Can 0.25 BTC change the life? 
hgu8bp7 comment Even with just 0.25btc, it's a life changing amount in many countries today. 
hguh6nt comment If BTC ever gets to $1m per coin, it'll be worth $250,000. Is $250,000 life-changing for you? Only you can answer that.

Will BTC get to $1m? Nobody can answer that. 
hguc3lq comment It's not enough but in terms of ROI it's better than investing or putting it in anything else. 
hgu32pr comment Nobody knows really. But it may perform better than having this amount on fiat (and related products) 
hgudm01 comment Yes if you lucky enough to reach the future 
hgu79mm comment I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs the right question. In 10 years, would you rather have .25 btc or fiat? 
hguj1hb comment Depends on country. 
hgu6188 comment How does 2.5 Million sound? 
hgu6w0x comment Personally 0.25 be pretty life changing today, but 20 years from now it'll be an amount of $ that could last for lifetimes. 
hgus52w comment The only thing that can change your life IS YOU! It doesn't matter whether or not you make any money, because in the end: it is material you decide has value. You need to look at the entire industry and not only bitcoin then decide where to lay out your portfolio and diversify it. Don't have that wishful attitude of "I hope my bitcoin goes up since it's the only thing I own" 
q96yex submission Which one are you more worried about? 
hgu3m2r comment What is this the Worry Olympics? Get a hold of yourself FFS. Don't worry. Prepare and sleep well. 
hgu3zne comment The reason we hold our Bitcoin keys is so we don‚Äôt have to worry as much.  Do you even Bitcoin Bro? 
hgu3kt8 comment Not Hodling 
hgu3gvy comment I‚Äôd say the Tether fraud. I wonder how it passed all the previous audits. Someone must have been paid off handsomely 
hgu3fkw comment Diversified assets - not worried about any of them. 
hgu66jl comment Uh, none of them, in any way?

1. They got fined, are paying, like infinite exchanges in the space. Nothing to see here.
2. Worried about good news? 
3. What possible way could this Chinese company collapsing harm bitcoin growth?

It's obvious you haven't been here for years. There comes a point when you come to understand that all news about bitcoin is good news for bitcoin. Even if it's as bad a country banning it or attacking it, there will be a larger upside to it that will reveal itself in time. Always. 
hgu5yoo comment Worried about people who worry too much. 
hgu6dfs comment Tether was so obvious imo. Coffeezilla‚Äôs video on the founders made it clear what sort of company they were. 

I‚Äôm looking forward to Evergrande tbh, see what the CCP pulls out of its pockets. 
hgu6mn0 comment In the long run bitcoin fuckin doesn't care about even one of these. 
hgu77jo comment Evergrande collapse doesnt matter China is irrelevant
