q8c1mw submission Best Way To Take A Loan Out With Bitcoin As Collateral 
hgoj7t0 comment Blockfi gives you a minimum $10k loan for about a 9% interest rate for one year, where you make interest payments every month then have to pay off the entire loan at the end of the term. They don't penalize you if you try to pay off early. You have to provide 200% of the loans dollar value in bitcoins. So at current ~$60k per bitcoin you would have to put up approximately 0.33 BTC as collateral for blockfi to hold as collateral if you borrowed $10k. Once you sign the loan agreement, they will wire $10k to your bank account within 1 business day. I believe blockfi rehypothecates your BTC so it is a risk. However, this is a great way to get money without selling the Bitcoin.

Assuming Bitcoin has a significantly higher valuation in the future then you can refinance your loan for possibly a longer loan term. If you default on your loan next year and, let's say Bitcoin is worth close to ~$150k next year then they would sell off 0.06 BTC of your collateral leaving you with 0.27 BTC. If BTC is worth $60k in a year then they will sell 0.167 BTC and give you back 0.167 BTC. But if BTC is worth $30k a year from now, and you default, then they will sell the entire stack. Also if it went as low as $30k then you would get margin called and have to put up additional BTC collateral to stop them from selling any of your original collateral since you have to maintain a loan to value ratio maximum, usually of 70%. Obviously try not to default so you can get your entire stack back.

Basically works the same for any lenders except interest rates are different. Also some lenders may not do rehypothecation but do your own research on those. Finally, some lenders will let you deposit bitcoins using multi sig wallets which should technically be safer to hold your Bitcoin, but they usually give the extra private keys to 3rd parties that they know, so idk if it is that much safer since they could just collaborate to move your Bitcoin. Ultimately, you are taking on risk of losing bitcoin, but atleast you get money to pay for things you want now, while your Bitcoin appreciates.

hgofhsx comment Check out Celsius and BlockFi. 
hgogdic comment Celsius 
hgonxej comment AS mentioned above, you can do it on AAVE. It’s DEFI so no paperwork, etc. Have to convert to BTC WBTC first. There are no set payment terms, you can take as long as you like to repay the loan as long as you don’t fall below the minimum LTV ratio, but interest will continue to accrue. It is safer to do this after BTC has had a large dip because then you are at less risk of losing LTV ratio due to drop in BTC value 
hgojqp2 comment I converted my btc to wbtc, then deposited those funds onto the aave platform using my meta mask wallet. 
hgp3jw3 comment nexo has low rates and is very smooth 
hgocrq7 comment Haven’t done it myself and depends on where you live but BlockFi is worth looking at 
hgouttx comment New car = terrible investment.  I buy beaters and they seem to last.  90s through early 2000s Toyota’s, Honda’s and Nissans.  Cheap and easy to fix and built to last.  I know this isn’t ideal for everyone but if you can find one in decent shape and have someone inspect it for you, if you’re not auto savvy, you will probably pay between 0 and 4K and it will probably last as long as you maintain it.  Just a suggestion.  Again, I know this isn’t ideal for most. 
hgpogmy comment https://lend.hodlhodl.com/ 
hgofr3a comment I would **never** do that.  It's not worth it to risk losing bitcoins.  

There are fees and interest, besides the risk of losing bitcoins, and in the long run you're better off just selling some bitcoins, and paying the taxes, then repaying yourself as soon as possible.

q8cpmn submission Wolff Responds: Why We Have Inflation Now 
hgp0ug5 comment stop posting communist's that shit is not cool. 
hgpfuai comment One thing that doesn't quite add up is that I'm not sure the shop owner actually does have a choice to simply order more units.

With more money in the economy, the value of dollars will go down, meaning that the manufacturer will charge more, too. 

And it's not like the manufacturer can just keep making units at the same price, either. They have raw materials to buy and employees to pay, all of which will cost more dollars, since each dollar is worth less. 

The **only** valid option is for prices to increase.

Just because you listen to one video does not mean I have only listened to 1 video. 
hgqja6n comment I was trying to be a little more subtle, but my point is that you are committing what is known as an "Ad Hominem" fallacy, where you are automatically dismissing his argument in this video because of his failings elsewhere.

The argument in this video ought to be judged upon its own merits and not the merits (or demerits) of the speaker. It doesn't matter if he's a communist. Is his argument valid?

q8cvvd submission Ted Cruz Says Bitcoin Mining Can Fix Texas’ Crumbling Electric Grid. The Republican senator expressed his faith that the mass buildout of crypto mines in the state could add additional energy capacity to the state’s grid in the event of blackouts or power shortages. 
hgpruz6 comment There sure are a lot of misguided comments in this thread.

Energy grids have to operate on a surplus, otherwise there will be blackouts if demand exceeds supply. But the unused surplus energy cannot be stored and is thus wasted. Bitcoin miners, who search for the cheapest possible energy and are buyers of last resort, can monetise this. The market for this is ***huge***.

Seems like this is a good time to plug one of my favourite Bitcoin podcasts, [Tales From The Crypt](https://tftc.io/podcasts/). It has a strong tilt towards mining and how Bitcoin feeds into the energy markets. Stay humble and stack sats, freaks. 
hgotnca comment tldr; Texas Sen. Ted Cruz believes Bitcoin mining could help the state's energy grid in the event of blackouts or power shortages. Bitcoin mines can shut down instantaneously, freeing up additional grid space for the heating and cooling of homes, hospitals, and other critical infrastructure. Cruz also pointed out the mining industry’s use of renewable energy.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-mining-reshaping-energy-sector-200439550.html 
hgoyugv comment God this sub is disappointing sometimes with its lack of critical thought. Of course Ted is right.

Crypto miner builds a new power plant and mines crypto 24/7. They know exactly how much money they make per kWh.

Now the traditional grid is about to hit a blackout. You have the crypto miner who would be happy to sell you energy at a premium to what they make mining.

BTC miners increasing the total energy produced in the state helps prevent blackouts.

hkhq8wl comment Ted just wants money for his wealthy buddies to invest.  To have the wealth gap grow.  I'm pro bitcoin and have skin in the game on that, but it should be mined with renewable energy.  Natural Gas providers are the ones who made sure there was a loophole to lock in sky high profits during bad weather events.  Rail Road Commissioner that regulates the Oil and Gas industry (seems a weird connection but historically, it makes sense) Cristy Craddock has financial interests in oil and gas companies she's supposed to regulate.

hgojtfa comment Plenty of room for everyone here. Left, Right, Center. I personally chose Up 
hgonvrb comment I'm a progressive and the promise of crypto that entices me is decentralization.

Banks, social media, internet tech.. they are all middle men that have amassed enormous amounts of power, when in fact their existence as private stakeholders is not inherently necessary for the products and services they provide. The possibility of eliminating/reducing these private centers of power that maximize profit at all costs outweighs any environmental concerns that crypto causes. That's how I see it. 
hgoq8ip comment framing is how you lie. bitcoin sells itself with plain to see truth. 
hgojtbz comment But isn’t it taxing in the environment to mine? 
hgp3py2 comment >I'm a progressive

Private centers of power bad.  More government power good.

Name checks out 
hgpdpwc comment Money tied to scarcity kills the system of free currency printed for military contracts. The military industry is by far the largest consumer of oil and the biggest polluter in the world. Add to this the fact that Bitcoin replaces a much more carbon intensive banking industry and the trade offs are totally worth it. Power usage isn't a problem; dirty power defended by a fiat backed military is the problem.

Anyway it was fine when banks were shoveling crap overhyped subprime loans and now they are are concerned about people borrowing fiat to buy an asset class that has been outperforming the market.. 
regulation did nothing except pin the whole crisis on a few scapegoats and it’s certainly not going to do much in crypto except make a few fat cats richer.

$4/gal gas will drive EV transition faster than anything else. The main reason EVs aren't dominant right now is that oil prices crashed a few years ago. 
hgoppit comment No.  I don't remember that.

One of the reasons why oil prices are going up is because Biden banned new drilling on Federal Land.

Another reason why oil is going up is because we stacked out a shit ton of equipment last year, and people are being very cautious about kicking back off again.

Less oil being produced means the price goes up.

q8em7h submission Literally breaking just now: SEC said to not oppose Bitcoin futures ETF 
hgox1pr comment Sorry for the bad source, it was the only source available at the time. Bloomberg broke the story, but they release their headlines first to only people who subscribe to their paid service before the general public gets to see it. That's why the headline existed a few minutes before the official article was posted.

Here's the *now public* Bloomberg article: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-15/bitcoin-futures-etf-said-not-to-face-sec-opposition-at-deadline?utm\_source=google&utm\_medium=bd&cmpId=google](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-15/bitcoin-futures-etf-said-not-to-face-sec-opposition-at-deadline?utm_source=google&utm_medium=bd&cmpId=google) 
hgp0w7q comment This is the bullish news we've been waiting for all year. Assuming the sources are legit (they probably are), this means the SEC examiners have told the ProShares lawyers (off the record) they have no further comments on the filings, and have cleared them to finalize. A Bitcoin ETF is a 100% thing at this point. 
hgp1qav comment What I don’t understand is why would someone rather have a futures ETF instead of an ETF at the current market spot traded price?

When someone purchases Amazon stock they’re not looking for Amazon futures.

The people in control are so brain dead stupid they refused to sell what the customers actually want. 
hgp1owl comment Gensler already said he’s not opposed to a futures based BTC ETF, but is opposed to those that are physically backed by BTC that they hold a while ago though. 

A BTC ETF that had to purchase BTC in backing would create more immediate short term demand, obviously, but how would a futures based ETF effect the price?  I mean, people are essentially just betting on what the price will be in the future?  Seems like it will be prone to tracking error and will have minimal impact on BTC price?

The regulator isn’t likely to block the products from starting to trade next week, said the people, who asked not to be named while discussing the decision. Unlike Bitcoin ETF applications that the regulator has previously rejected, the proposals by ProShares and Invesco Ltd. are based on futures contracts and were filed under mutual fund rules that SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has said provide “significant investor protections.”

hgpdujn comment I bought my first Bitcoin on Robinhood at its ATH. After getting screwed over by Robinhood and becoming aware of how awful its platform is for crypto I decided to open a Coinbase account and get off Robinhood. This realization happened to come after Bitcoin tanked to 30K. Although I wanted to sell my Bitcoin off Robinhood I was unwilling to take the loss so I took an equal amount of money which was a huge risk because it was all I had and bought into Bitcoin on Coinbase and left the Bitcoin on Robinhood with the intention of selling once or should I say if it rose back to where I bought in. It finally rose back to that level and I sold.

q8fdl1 submission Bitcoin ETF vs Bitcoin futures ETF 
hgp45sm comment Because they're slave's to the banks and futures allow banks to manipulate the spot price more easily over the long run. The only way to avoid manipulation is for people to avoid futures ETF in favor of the real deal.

Bingo 
hgpmqrf comment Can you elaborate on that? I still don't get how you can manipulate the spot price with a future. 

As I understand it, this is just people gambling to guess what the future price of BTC will be, I don't see a direct correlation with the real price? (Unless the same people is shorting the real BTC and therefore the entire market is highly leveraged, where you could get some sort of short squeeze?)

q8fezp submission How does Bitcoin avoid the initial transaction verification getting too long? 
hgp5kz0 comment The block size has a fixed maximum size.  

The average time between blocks, about ten minutes, fixed.  

The typical transaction size is such that the entire Bitcoin blockchain is limited to a maximum of about 7 transactions per second.  

That works out to about 18 million transactions per month - not enough for mass adoption.  

When there are a lot of transactions, the blocks get full, the transactions queue up.  The highest-paying transactions go first.  The cost of getting a transaction confirmed "right away" goes way up.  

Increasing the block size is futile, increases the time for new nodes to sync, increases the costs to run a full node - both storage costs and bandwidth.  The more nodes, the better.  

One solution: Lightning Network, or some other 2nd layer.  L/N aims to provide millions of transactions per second, for just a few sats per transaction.  

Your questions are good - they show critical thinking and a natural curiosity.  Those are valuable qualities. 
hgp1mi1 comment not exponentially. linearly. yes it is getting bigger at a somewhat predictable rate since the blocks are limited in size (see: block size wars). bitcoin is handling the issue fine.  it's all part of the design considerations.  isn't it great? 
hgpgacd comment You have to download the entire blockchain and verify it. Other networks offer milestones, but these lead to bugs/ inflation that never get found.

Thats why its so important to keep the blocksize small, so everyone is able to have its own copy☆1. For more decentralization.
For me it took 2,5 days to download the ledger.

☆1 Dont trust, verify ! 
hgtcljw comment If you have an up to date node you can copy it and all its data and start it without reverifying from zero. Or you can tell it to verify all signatures again. Your choice.

Blockchain data isn't in memory, it's on disk. Pruning is deleting older block data on disk. Bitcoin blockchain does not grow exponentially bigger, only linearly bigger. Blocks will not get too big, they have a weight limit beyond which they are invalid. 
hgpj3oh comment Blocks have a fixed size limit and Bitcoin's "difficulty adjustment" makes sure a new block is found every 10 minutes on average. The result is linear blockchain growth. 
hgr6o0p comment Read: Merkle Tree 
hgp38lk comment You're right, linear on the amount of transactions, although I'm unsure if it's linear on the number of users.

Limiting the size of blocks makes a lot of sense, I'll look into block size wars. 

I imagine it's all in the design considerations as they are basic questions, but I still want to understand.

So if block are limited in size, and block verification is somewhat fixed in time, is this solved with slower verification? How does the network handle more blocks per unit of time?

Edit: spelling 
hgp3ip4 comment taproot, coming next month, will allow 30% increase in transactions per block. But the main thing is layer 2 solution call the **lightning network** which will allow billions of transactions per second with 0 fee. 
hgp3yse comment The network automatically adjusts the difficulty of mining essentially depending on how many miners there are.  If there are a lot of miners, the difficulty increases, and vice versa. This ensures a block is mined *on average* every 10 minutes.

hgp6p1m comment I wouldn't use a hot wallet on windows.

On Android and iOS, i'd recommend Blue Wallet and Coinomi 
hgq384k comment Hi, Andy from AirGap here.

You could give our wallet a try. There are 2 apps, one of which holds the private key (similar to a HW wallet), the other one only holds public information. Ideally, the app with the private key (AirGap Vault) should be installed on an offline device for best security, but you can also use it as a hot wallet by having both apps on your online device. There are some security advantages to having 2 separate apps on the same device. As an example, the Vault application does not require internet access, so on Android it doesn't actually have permissions to access the internet, on iOS you could turn your phone into airplane mode before you start the Vault to prevent any info from leaking. So that makes it a lot more secure, by design.

bitcoin is a push mechanism and fiat is a pull mechanism so when the bitcoins gone its gone forever and you got nothing

so most likely if you dont get real bitcoin you going to end up with nothing cuz the fed and that well they dont like bitcoin so.. 
hgqpuot comment Your "solution" is highly likely to be different than mine.  

I never was a big fan of IRAs and 401Ks, though I did participate some.  

It didn't take long for my initial Bitcoin investment to dwarf my savings + IRA + 401K.  

I just let them sit there.  Why not?  I'm not desperate to get "bitcoin exposure" -- I have actual Bitcoins.  I appreciate the difference, for various reasons.  

If I had a huge nest egg in an IRA/401K and very little Bitcoin, I would cash out, buy actual Bitcoin, then send it to my hardware wallet.  

I know better than to trust the government.

You asked me to manage this. You are trusting my judgement. I’ve been doing this for years, watching the charts, reading the news, keeping myself informed. 

My advice is,

Time IN the market will ALWAYS beat timing the market.

HODL.

(They might look at you weirdly, but it’ll be a cool flex on your parents. Especially when you’re proved right.) 
hgp74oz comment Same with my dad till I blocked him 
hgp8yo6 comment Over the course of a year, you would have to beat hodl by more than your short term cap gains rate AND a year of commissions (which are very punitive in crypto), before you even start to show a net gain on the approach.  And that’s IF you can trade profitably and manage to capture and exceed the general up trend, which is unlikely for most if not just about all who attempt.

You’ll also create a lot of nasty tax paperwork in the process.  Suppose you manage to exit near the top of a giant drop (which is occurring almost none of the time), you need literally around a 35% drop before your profit even begins on a dip re-entry.

This is all vastly oversimplified but you probably get the point.  If you mean constant “scalping” small gyrations/noise, now you’re attempting to compete with AI/machine driven market makers.  Can you beat your computer at level 10 chess?  Most of us obviously can not.

In fact the blocks aren't really mined at all, they're produced every minute by a set of 15 functionaries (companies) who have installed secure hardware modules in various locations and jurisdictions around the globe that essentially lets them take turns extending the blockchain and processing transactions.

A recent upgrade to the network was just released in the last couple weeks that will allow this set of functionaries to grow and change over time.

11 of the 15 functionaries would need to collude together to censor transactions or otherwise disrupt the network or abscond with the BTC collateral that is pegged in to back the L-BTC. As long as you trust that these companies are sufficiently independent, mutually distrusting, and incentivized to behave rather than misbehave, you can be assured that the network is censorship resistant and safe to use. 

In my opinion it's pretty darn good, these companies are good actors in the Bitcoin space and the network is way more decentralized and trustworthy than a platform from one of the tech giants would be.

q8gqwx submission Monumentally Stupid Question: How Do I Get Bitcoin out of Bitcoin Core? [super old legacy wallet] 
hgpaqmt comment Anyone DMing you is a scammer. I'd honestly just let it try to catch up and transfer out when it does. You've got the backup if that doesn't work out. 
hgpd5vs comment You can export the private key from Bitcoin Core and import it into Electrum 
hgpfvee comment Should have named it .dat ass. So you could... you know... back .dat ass up 🤣🤣 
hgpnnmj comment Run a current version of Core. Use the `noconnect` option to stop it initializing the blockchain (otherwise, you'll still be waiting in 2 weeks). Use the `dumpwallet` command to save the keys and addresses in a text file  

Install Electrum. Sweep the keys from the dumpwallet text file into Electrum. Send Bitcoin to charity

hgpnlqf comment You should download a modern Bitcoin Core binary and sync that. It's going to be impossibly slow if you're running a binary from 2012 
hgpaubg comment you don't "back up the .dat file to a new wallet".  you create a new wallet and send your funds there.  or don't. that's fine too. you have your bitcoin. 
hgpe8ze comment Just HODL that shit. Keep the dat file super safe. 
hgpo7w9 comment di dyou also back up the core executable? Would that dat file open in newer versions. 
hgsaosg comment Bitcoin Core that old may not even be able to fully sync to the modern network.

Various serious limits with disk and block sizes were ironed out in the early days.

I'd suggest running a current version of Core on a modern machine. I *think* if you drop the old wallet.dat into it's data directory, it'll make it work. 
hgtbzu7 comment In console use dumpwallet c:\temp\mahkeez.txt

Then you can import or sweep private keys into another wallet.

hgpoldh comment Can the war start on Monday? It’s Friyaay and I’m pumped for a good weekend!!🍻 
hgpneyf comment It’s easy to mistake we are not at war when I’m sipping a coffee and watching inane you tube videos 
hgpqtad comment Reality is they are at war between each others! When you have control, you want more and you don't want someone else to have control. (That's what leads to wars btw, so we are not at war, we are free from control and Bitcoin does not care about anything outside its own world)

They will destroy themselves, some will actually **embrace** Bitcoin, not try to stop it, because it will give them advantages over the competing governments / banks... Then it's just game theory.

This is why Bitcoin is inevitable. We don't need to do anything, they are building their own graves. And they can't prevent that from happening ha! 
hgq8aam comment "They will try to destroy bitcoin, no matter the good that Bitcoin does."

I mean this is just nonsense. They now own bitcoin and have been buying it for years. The FUD they've spread was merely calculated to bring the price down so they could load up with more. They won't destroy it. They'll just pretend they are trying to.

hgpt1ca comment Today my whole first Bitcoin is complete and I am here to celebrate it with you all 
hgqmbuo comment I feel the poverty leaving my body 
hgpfnwu comment I almost feel guilty watching these gains. I started buying BTC at $57k on the downhill from the ATH.  I kept DCAing despite the price going down to $29k.  At one point I was down a few thousand, and I was pretty scared.  But I kept buying because I kept studying BTC and became a believer, even though it was my blood in the streets.  I worked extra shifts to buy more.  

My average cost got all the way down to $36k and is now ticking up at $38k.  And I’m up a lot more than I was down. A whole lot more.

It feels great… but I almost feel some guilt about making so much (for me) by just waiting.

Almost. 
hgrbzf8 comment My wife thinks I’m a genius again 
hgpgz9r comment I entered Btc near ATH in april, continued DCA all summer. Was stressed because I was pouring € in an investment in big loss. Wasn't really feeling good, but I was so convinced by the fundamentals!
Now I'm in green!!

No soldier will be left behind, because the mission aint over yet.

Cheers.

hgpe88z comment tldr; The price of Bitcoin rallied 8.2% to an intraday high of $58,532 on Oct. 14 as the possibility of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) being approved by the end of October continues to drive speculation and price action across the crypto market. Badger DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization focused on building products and infrastructure around Bitcoin’s utility in DeFi, has seen a 187% increase in its price since October 1.

q8hhqh submission For everybody saying: "Bitcoin futures ETF is bad"... 
hgqx9y6 comment Tell that to precious metal holders. Gold market is one of the most manipulated markets out there and its price has been suppressed for decades using futures and other derivatives. Yes, it would be irresponsible not to buy underlying asset for protection, but who said that banks are responsible? They've been naked shorting huge quantities of contracts whenever they need to suppress price. Currently, the amount of "paper" gold traded 100+ times higher than the amount of allocated gold.

What will happen if everyone redeems? They'll fail, as failed before. And since they are "too big to fail" they'll be bailed out again with taxpayer money or newly printed money, which is basically the same. 
hgpfnst comment A Bitcoin futures ETF undermines BTCs main value proposition, that of scarcity. In the long run, it will be damaging in my opinion. 
hgpfh9m comment … or they already have it. 
hgprutx comment Gold and Silver were currencies too. Look what paper derivatives have done for their value. 
hgpn6yp comment Can someone explain how that works: if someone needs to protect themselves from large up moves why do they have to buy BTC and not just use their fiat? Future based BTC is not backed by BTC which means they don’t have to cover their losses with BTC i thought 
hgqlyy4 comment Have you considered that not everyone is purely focused on the price alone? 
hgpssd3 comment IMHO futures are an inevitable evil, it would undermine BTCs value, but also legitimate BTC. But most importantly it will bring fresh investor money to BTC, this could help to stabilize USD/BTC price. More market cap, more stability.

Look at other commodities e.g. Oil, oil has practical day-to-day usage, like Bitcoin. People will still buy and use Bitcoin. Futures are more for traders and people who like to leverage. 
hgpxeby comment There is way, way more paper gold and silver than there is physical. 
hgstqxw comment For me this is just another way for whales to manipulate the price of BTC beyond the the simple dynamic of supply and demand and this is why the SEC has not stood in the way of it. It satisfies Wall Street's conflict over their fear of decentralization that BTC brings to financial markets and how to get some of the massive low cost profits that exchanges make. It was inevitable that this would happen at some point, but I can't agree it is a good thing. The only positive thing, and it is temporary, is that it raises Bitcoins financial legitimacy with legacy institutions and it will increase price in the short term. I guess we will have to disagree on this one

hgpw1ad comment For all the flack he gets from the Bitcoin community - some arguments from Peter Schiff do make you want to research the points he's making, which in turn expands your own knowledge about crypto and the general economy.

Conversely, Jamie Dimon simply throwing it surface-level knee-jerk opinions I don't bother giving the time of day i.e. saying its worthless because I said so, even though I don't understand it. These I can only conclude are from ignorance, or ulterior motives

At the end of the day we are not much different from them, just think how we ignore other crucially important areas in our lives - keep your back straight, eat healthy, look after your eyes, exercise. Health is our most important asset, yet most of us ignore it and take it for granted until it is too late and we feel like we missed out. No wonder people tend to ignore other - less important areas in their lives.

hgpsj0d comment My friend, I think you got it all wrong and you found yourself in a place you don’t even recognize.

You have built, for the last three years, a business. You have done research, you have learnt, you have created a portfolio and you have created a strategy. You have a job in cripto now. People around you value that but they have other jobs. They don’t want to learn and go through your journey because they have other things to do.

Now, do you think you could take their money and make a profit with it? Would you take a cut? Would they accept it? 

It’s not that other people are lazy, which they are, it’s just that they have other source of income. Will yours be BTC? 
hgpukt3 comment It's really hard to reason from first principles and be confident in ones reasoning powers. As a shortcut... People go with "safety in numbers" or "if famous people say it must be truth" or "do what everyone does and avoid all outliers" or some equivalent of herd thinking...
BTC challenges everything... Even Austrian economics gurus (Jeffrey tucker) got stumped... It took years for me to see how btc has value (thanks to saifedean ammous  and saylor)... Despite having computer science degree...

Some jump in bcoz of number goes up technology... Some jump in for gambling... Some jumpin because their fiat is collapsing so rapidly and desperately need an out...

It's extremely rare soul who gets btc right away... It takes time to process so many new concepts and paradigm shifts!

So it's totally understandable why crowd is slow... That's what allow us to front run the crowd!

"Have fun staying poor!" 
hgpjixv comment this is a fact of life that is actually not that easy to learn, because literally almost everyone is an idiot, and it takes many years to sort through all of the stupidity you've been fed, and the people who you formerly trusted but who never deserved trust.  it's really hard to come to terms with, seriously. and that's why most people never do. they just delude themselves because it's too hard to admit your parents and childhood friends are all morons.  and actually much of what makes them a moron is that they aren't brave enough to admit their loved ones are dumb. ignorance really and a shared delusion. it's why mass hysteria reigns in times like these. it's best just to treat most people like pets. pity them, but don't reason with them.  don't ruin christmas for them. they'll never believe santa isn't real anyway. welcome to adulthood. most people never get here including most "adults". it's bittersweet. mostly bitter. but perhaps i'm projecting a bit. and digressing.
