hgkwxlt comment The haters in the comments are fascinating. Why do they hate Bitcoin so much? Why are they so closed minded and unwilling to even try to understand it? 
hgl244f comment Back when I was first interested in BTC, doing some research and learning about what it actually was, the extreme reactions were one of the things that helped convinced me that BTC wasn't just a solid idea with the potential to actually be work - it was *important*.

Healthy skepticism is good, change is scary and anything to do with money invariably gets under people skin, after all.

My thinking was that when an idea is as polarising as crypto, for everybody who hates it with a burning passion there will be people at the opposite end of the spectrum, and at that time that was what BTC needed - strong hands and passionate advocates. 
hglbowv comment Usually because it's new and scary, disrupting their current understanding of the world. This can be unsettling and results in them immediately rejecting it. I think it's a primal reaction, like when uncontacted humans are met or in chimps. You see it in new technology all the time, electricity, the car etc.

The other is they're afraid they missed the boat and so they must discredit because if Bitcoin succeededs they'd be left with nothing. This is partially true but it's not too late at all.

Yes, I used **distributed contracts** as that's how it was defined in the [Bitcoin wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contract). Probably the correct term these days is indeed **smart contracts**, as that's how it's defined in the more current project [RGB](https://rgb-org.github.io/) and in other projects as well.

q7phy9 submission Bitcoin ATMs allow you to buy crypto up to certain amount with just name and phone number 
hgk9izz comment There is not a specific dollar amount of bitcoin that bitcoin ATM operators in the US are allowed to sell customers without requiring their ID. Some bitcoin ATMs in the US let customers buy $2,000 or more worth of bitcoin without ID. For example, bitcoin ATMs operated by Athena allow customers buy $2,000 worth of bitcoin with just their name and phone number. There is varying levels of KYC. KYC can vary from as little as your name and phone number to as much as your home address, social security number, employment, and income.

Bitcoin ATM operators in the United States need to register with FinCEN and have an AML compliance policy in place. State level regulation varies from state to state, and targets requirements to register for money transmitter license (MTL) or money service business (MSB). Most of the states will also require a surety bond to run bitcoin ATM machines. Operators need to keep track of records of transactions, conduct and collect identification information and also report information to agencies under particular circumstances. 

Apart from registering with FinCEN bitcoin ATM operator has to develop its own KYC/AML compliance policy. This document doesn‚Äôt need to be provided to FinCEN during registration, however it should be available on request. The main purpose of such a policy is to prevent your bitcoin machine being used to money laundering. AML program has to address the following items, also known as ‚Äú4 pillars‚Äù:

Define Policies, Procedures and Internal Controls. Incorporate policies, procedures and internal controls reasonably designed to assure compliance with the BSA and its implementing regulations. These policies need to address risk size expected by operator based on conditions and area of operation, various transaction monitoring and documenting techniques etc.;

Dedicated Compliance Officer.  Designate a person to assure day-to-day compliance with the program and the BSA and its implementing regulations. This should be a person with expertise in the field. Moreover, such an officer should have relative independence and authority within organization. This should be a person, who doesn‚Äôt obtain other functional roles, e.g. to eliminate conflict of interest, while limiting transaction due to prevention measures will potentially reduce revenue volume of operator;
Employee Training.  Provide education and training of appropriate personnel concerning their responsibilities under the program, including training in the detection of suspicious transactions, to the extent that the MSB is required to report such transactions under the BSA;

Independent Audits.  Provide for independent review to monitor and maintain an adequate program. This can be done by other employees / team in the organization, as well as by third-party consultancy service providers.

Once the program and processes are implemented ‚Äî it is recommended for operator to do full test of transactions flow and documenting all steps. Tests need to include checking of set thresholds and limits as well as all KYC verification procedures and tracking and documenting of customers data. Manufacturers of ATMs provide integrated solutions in their software. It is recommended to check with each provider what the implementation is, so that it cover needs of being compliant with law.

On state level regulators have another requirement to register as money transmitter. This regulation varies from state to state, while some states being more relaxed, some are very strict in this regard.

hgkejl2 comment OP - Have you thought about using a disguise and fake name and running away to Thailand? Then buying bitcoin there? I find the fees too high at most bitcoin ATMs and kiosk. Just my take. 
hgkc0cl comment Excellent - response.

So basically each ATM company can decide what is their threshold ..there is no specific law about threshold apart from fincen tells them to have 4 pillar policy and than implement that policy strictly correct?

I understand atm cos need to keep records of ID info but if someone can give fake name and disposable no.  so how can they rely on this type of KYC/id verification and share that with govt authorities ?

They can also keep record of where each of crypto went to ..for example which wallets/address it went to but unless it goes to centralized exchange - what is the use of these records because those address will not connect to any person ..

I fail to understand how these businesses run legally? Why govt authorities make it clear to them ..banks will do full kyc even if you want to open an account for only 5$ savings account. ..so why different law apply to these money transmitter busienss? 
hgkf62h comment lol ..dont get wrong impression ..am not discussing this to buy crypto at ATM but I am wondering - how can they all have different KYC requirement ...and allow ppl to buy with name and no. when we all know one can use fake no. and fake name... ..just like to discuss various issues ..reddit is like brain storm opportunity for me 
hgkfktj comment >So basically each ATM company can decide what is their threshold ..there is no specific law about threshold apart from fincen tells them to have 4 pillar policy and than implement that policy strictly correct?

Correct. 

>I understand atm cos need to keep records of ID info but if someone can give fake name and disposable no. so how can they rely on this type of KYC/id verification and share that with govt authorities ?

Low dollar value transactions of like $250-$900 or less are just not a big deal because there they are not really a money laundering risk because they are such low value transactions. I suppose someone could keep using different phone numbers and fake names, but don't forget that all bitcoin ATMs also have a camera in them.

>They can also keep record of where each of crypto went to ..for example which wallets/address it went to but unless it goes to centralized exchange - what is the use of these records because those address will not connect to any person

I'm not knowledgeable enough about this because I don't work for FinCEN. I can think of various situations where these records would be useful for FinCEN, the IRS, or police. Most of these records will never be looked at by anyone. But these ATM operators must send a suspicious activity report (SAR) to FinCEN if they detect anything suspicious (like someone using different phone numbers and fake names to avoid providing their ID).

>banks will do full kyc even if you want to open an account for only 5$ savings account.

Consider this for a moment, when you withdraw cash from a bank, the bank has no idea what you are doing with it. Those dollars are no longer connected to any person. I fail to see how that is any less of a risk than a bitcoin ATM.

>so why different law apply to these money transmitter busienss?

Because they are just a money service business and not a financial institution with a banking charter. 
hgldrk3 comment > there is no specific law about threshold apart from fincen tells them to have 4 pillar policy and than implement that policy strictly correct?

That's for Federal compliance. Each state has different requirements for state law compliance - state registration as a money services business  

Generally, an operator will set a limit according to his own perception of risk, and implement a procedure to detect if a buyer is structuring - repeatedly visiting the machines and buying under the limit. I guess the phone number helps with this, especially if they're able to block no-KYC phone numbers 
hgkfpjh comment Apt analysis 
hgl6mwe comment 1. So money service business has less responsibilities than a bank?
2. Lets discuss another point in little more details...Those ATMs can share name + number of the clients and may be they take pics without clients knowledge and share records with govt authorities but what is the use - unless authorities use artificial intelligence and from pics authorities can decode who this person is - there is no point of any records. 
hgl8b72 comment 1. Yes, financial institutions are more heavily regulated than money service businesses. A simple cash checking store is a money service business. You are a money service business and you need an MSB license if you offer one of the following services: check cashing, prepaid debit cards, currency exchange, traveler‚Äôs checks, money transfers, or money orders. 

2. I can't answer this because I don't work for FinCEN and I don't operate a bitcoin ATM. 

I remember reading about a dark web drug ring that was busted because of their suspicious activity using bitcoin ATMs to sell bitcoin for cash. This bust was only possible because of the regulations and reporting of the bitcoin ATM operators. https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/nyregion/dark-web-drug-dealing.html 
hglefxq comment Law enforcement don't need AI to do face matching. They can use humans

> Those ATMs can share name + number of the clients and may be they take pics without clients knowledge and share records with govt authorities but what is the use

You have a misconception about money laundering law enforcement. Law enforcement agencies don't have the resources to monitor, so they persuaded the lawmakers to offload this role to the banks and money businesses. The information is collected by the MSB, but only shared on request. MSBs waste millions collecting all this data, and it's only useful when an agency wants to collect evidence on a specific suspect  

The law requires the MSB to recognize a money laundering behavior pattern and report it to an authority. There's a well-known obligation to report amounts over USD10,000, and an additional obligation to report suspicious behavior. That's why the limits are so far under USD10,000, and also why some operators ask for full KYC for any amount

hgkcb8g comment Kraken. IMO. Best exchange to buy and transfer 
hgkf0j5 comment I stopped using exchanges a long time ago for this reason. I DCA through [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/cooperhodls/) now since their fees for DCA is the lowest I‚Äôve found. I can also smash buy a big chunk if there‚Äôs a significant price movement with lower fees compared to Coinbase, Kraken or Gemini. 
hgkfdby comment Always check the fine print for your exchange rate at the time of buying. It doesn't always match the price you see fluctuating through out the day 
hgkd5s2 comment I have not used that exchange but normally you have to set your buy price to get it at said price 
hgkdx38 comment It‚Äôs common for the price to fluctuate while making a market order. That, plus there are probably transaction fees baked in there. Always buy using a limit order because then you‚Äôre guaranteed to get the price you are asking for. You‚Äôll also pay a maker fee which is typically less than a taker fee (ie. market order).

As far as exchanges, they all have their pros and cons. You‚Äôre one Google search away from finding out the differences between them and figuring out which one suits your needs. I personally like FTX and Coinbase Pro because they have some of the lowest fees.

Bitcoin is obviously much more volatile and the long term regulatory and tax environment for it are not yet clear.  This is a personal choice that only you can make.

If I were in your shoes, I would keep the house and use the cash flow from it to buy Bitcoin every month.  I am a cautious guy, so you may have other ideas. 
hgkiacz comment I would keep the cash flow and just put that money into bitcoin every month (if you dont need it)‚Ä¶if you really are thinking about selling the second house I would still not put it all into bitcoin at once and DCA whatever amount you feel comfortable with.

An $80k mortgage at 4.5% is $405/mo. In theory, and based on your numbers, you could pull out $80k for bitcoin tax free (loans are not income therefore not taxable) and still cashflow $45/mo. Now you're invested in bitcoin AND real estate. True diversification is spreading yourself out over different asset classes and both are good investments.

q7s8rj submission BIP39 seed phrases: their flaws and how to use securely 
hgkr8oy comment [Here's the answer from Thomas Voegtlin, the creator of Electrum](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2016-August/013061.html) 
hgkzg22 comment What I've read is that essentially BIP39 seed phrases became the industry standard while Electrum's system did not. Despite this, Electrum Wallet still defaults to creating a seed using their standard, but it does allow you to import a BIP39 seed phrase if you look for the option. (It is actually possible to generate a BIP39 seed phrase in Electrum's console if you know the python commands. See [https://www.reddit.com/r/Electrum/comments/m6umdh/comment/grd5o42/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Electrum/comments/m6umdh/comment/grd5o42/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3))

I went through this same question, and I eventually decided to use a BIP39 seed phrase. It is the industry standard and is supported by all hardware wallets. The disadvantages of BIP39 seem to affect the developers of software wallets far more than they do the actual user.

I ended up concluding that what BIP39 does is extremely simple, so it arguably doesn't need a version or account number of address type embedded within it. All it does is encode 128 to 256 bits of entropy into 12 to 24 common English words. It also includes a checksum to help you catch an error. Even though the BIP39 seed doesn't tell you what derivation path you used to generate receive addresses, I believe that if you are holding your own keys, you should know yourself which account number and address type you are using. Write those pieces of information down with the seed if they are nonstandard. 
hgkvsl1 comment I agree and love your curiosity! 
hgkz3o0 comment Like you're planning, I use:

* Electrum

* Airgapping

* BIP39

The only thing I'd say with regard to doing this, is just to make sure you write down the **derivation path(s)** on the same place where you write down your seed.

p.s. In addition to the above, to generate the BIP39 seed in the first place, I use an *offline* copy of this website:

https://iancoleman.io/bip39/

...with a bunch of dice or coins. 
hgkzo95 comment there's not a ton to know. you summed it up pretty well. save the derivation path or wallet name with your bip39 mnenomic. that's what i always recommend. and if you forget, it will probably be fine, or at most probably be a little annoying. it's possible you could end up losing access to your funds if you select a custom derivation path (which would have to be very intentional) and then lose it. but then again, you can probably brute force it eventually. 
hglfnvc comment One thing you're missing is that Electrum's system was developed before BIP39 was written. The Electrum developer could have chosen to adopt BIP39 after it was ready, but the lack of a version number makes it inferior to his system, so he chose not to migrate to an inferior method

> The crux of their argument, I think, is that the seed itself is not enough to be able to recover crypto if they lose access to or forget the specific software that generated addresses from their seed that they sent crypto to

The point is that if the specification evolves as a result of experience, BIP39 will be replaced by a similar system which has versioning. Then all the no-version recovery mnemonics become obsolete. After a few years, users will be crowding the support forums wondering why their old mnemonic phrases stopped working  

In fact, the seed itself is not enough, because BIP39 only covers the creation of the words and hashing the words into a master private key. See https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki

> This seed can be later used to generate deterministic wallets using BIP-0032 or similar methods

BIP32 has multiple incompatible derivation paths. See https://walletsrecovery.org/  

That problem is not relevant to the Electrum developer's decision to add a version number to his mnemonic system

> If I knew what the flaws were

The flaw is the lack of a version number  

.  

The underlying issue is that some people ignore their Bitcoin for years, and then discover their wallets are no longer supported because the software disappeared some years earlier. Compounding this, most people in this forum and other forums advise new users that their BIP39 mnemonic will work forever - 10 years or 20 years into the future  

Whether you choose Electrum, or choose Electrum with a BIP39 mnemonic generated elsewhere, or use a different app, you should make sure your wallet is still accessible 2 or 3 times per year. This will give you enough time to replace the wallet app and send the coins to a new wallet if the wallet app's developer abandons it  

Bitcoin is only 12 years old, and there is already a history of old wallets being very difficult to access - multibit, old versions of blockchain.info, even old backups of the schildbach wallet, due to changes in default settings for encrypting the backup file  

In all this time, new versions of Bitcoin Core are able to open old versions of Core wallets, all the way back to the original. The format has changed a few times. Having a version number in the wallet file helps to keep this working 
hglgxff comment >they lack ‚Äúversioning‚Äù and require a ‚Äúfixed wordlist‚Äù (2048 words)

The problem is BIP39 uses the words instead of the numbers that the words represent. Because of this, there is no point using a version number when the word list is considered final. I personally think it's a poor design even if the word list is considered final, but it doesn't affect anything, including security.

>forget the specific software

If you use a BIP39 wallet, you need three components to recover the wallet: the seed words, the derivation path, and the passphrase. The derivation path is only to some extent standardized. If your wallet app uses an uncommon derivation path, you may have difficulty recover your wallet with a different wallet app. This is why you should also keep safe the name of the wallet software and ideally also the date/year it's used to create the wallet. This is so that you will be able to find out the derivation path. https://walletsrecovery.org/ has an unofficial list of derivation paths of various wallets. 
hglh5mh comment > BIP39 seed phrases became the industry standard

An industry standard with a specification document marked "Unanimously Discourage for implementation"  
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki 
hglynw9 comment You are free not to use BIP39. I have a feeling that those who do will not have a problem in 50 years finding tools that derive private keys and addresses from their seed phrases. If someone is holding their own keys and uses some random account number but forgets or doesn't move funds to a newer address type when they become widely adopted for security, privacy, or some other reason, that is on them. 
hgm1n1x comment > I have a feeling

You'd have a different feeling if you saw all the "please help" posts from old multibit users  
https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/q8iqt4/multibit_classic_recovery/

> finding tools that derive private keys and addresses from their seed phrases

There are tools for recovering old multibit wallets. They're very difficult to use  

There are instructions for recovering old Schildbach wallet backups. They're really simple

    openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -md md5 -a -in bitcoin-wallet-backup-testnet-2014-11-01 > bitcoin-wallet-decrypted-backup

The important part is `-md md5`  
These rescue instructions have about a 50% success rate  

Your 50-years-future BIP39 recovery will work, for about 1% of users who need it

Of course, when the US CBDC is implemented and forced upon the populace, every single transaction made by every American in the system will be tracked.  So, mass economic surveillance was coming anyway.  Unfortunately, I suspect that the average person will be indifferent to this invasion of our privacy because they'll say something like, " I don't care; I don't have anything to hide".  But what these fools don't realize is that the Government will FIND ways to use this information against the average citizen.  Therefore, I feel like our only way to combat this tyranny is to start shifting all of our monetary and financial dealings to crypto.  Every day moving forward, it's going to get easier and easier to buy, sell, save, borrow, etc using nothing but crypto.  We are all standing at a fork in the road.  One fork leads us to surveillance and tyranny.  The other leads us to independence, freedom and prosperity.  I think all of us here know which one to take.

hgp7gjs comment I just woke my wife up to tell her the good bitcoin news and how we just went straight the hell up and the ETFs are coming and whatnot and she threw my fucking lamp at me man. It's in pieces now. I'm not really mad though cuz I know I'll be able to buy a lot of lamps in the future, but I bought that thing and a goldfish at a South Florida flea market in 93 and it was one of my favorites. That lamp was over 28 years old. It was irreplaceable!!!! What the fuck.. I still got the goldfish, at least she didn't throw Bruce at me too. Keep rising bitcoin! Bust down $60k! I'm going to the couch now y'all have a most blessed night!

q7swa9 submission Central Banks are watching Bitcoin's organic success and they're starting to get worried about losing control of money, so they will deploy CBDCs in an attempt to combat Bitcoin. They will fail. 
hgkv1rg comment They've been watching Bitcoin since 2013 at least. 
hglnz3b comment I have been watching bitcoin since the beginning. The financial revolution we all talk about used to be funny to me lol, but seeing big money and government squirming to save themselves now... dang I'm scared someone is gonna get hurt. It's not funny really. They could just buy bitcoin but they're still afraid of not being in control. Still can't see what we all did. God bless us all, see you on the side guys. It's gonna be a wild next decade.

Either you believe in it or you don‚Äôt. Bitcoin has proven itself as a store of value. I guarantee the next cycle people will be saying ‚Äúidk if it‚Äôll go to 1 million or zero‚Äù while it‚Äôs sitting at 250k.

hgkunpa comment This headline is comparable to the one that Satoshi wrote into Bitcoin's genesis block.

hgkzrqv comment Longer than forever? 
hgl0s5e comment tldr; The Federal Reserve expressed concerns about inflation during a September meeting, with participants warning it may be having a "larger or more persistent effects" than what is "currently believed." "Most participants saw inflation risks as weighted to the upside because of concerns that supply disruptions and labor shortages might last longer," the minutes of the meeting read. The Fed also discussed the possibility of gradually reducing its monthly asset purchases.

hgpq3pq comment Rising prices are caused by inflation, the result of printing money. Get rid of the federal credit card a.k.a. the federal reserve bank. 
hglcid5 comment Stack those sats 
hgloo5d comment Quantitative easing isn't money printing. It swaps Bank Reserves for Treasuries Bills. The Bank Reserves are only collateral though and can't be spent, only borrowed against on the banks' own risk. Treasuries are effectively taken out of circulation, keeping their price high by decreasing their supply and preventing speculation (which would make interest rates shoot up, bankrupting the entire economy if permitted). The only thing that is increased by QE is the monetary base.

In the past, surpressing interest rates via QE led to an increase in lending (higher demand because money is cheap), which would increase M2 and ultimately lead to inflation and be perceived as money printing. That's where the problem lies: We wish QE would trigger an increase in lending, leading to more economic activity. However, it doesn't anymore. QE is only good for manipulating the price of the government's and corporate debt at this point (when you drove yields to zero already). I don't see what else it is good for.

Given the labour market, I don't think they will start a taper. They would just kill tge economy.

Buy bitcoin. 
hgkz2rs comment I‚Äôm so fucking glad I invest in Crypto man 
hglkyqm comment Fun fact: The models used to predict inflation use "inflation exepectations" as a part to predict what the inflation will be. They believe that what the population thinks the inflation will be, will affect what the actual inflation will be. It sounds logical, however its based on nothing and has no empirical evidence or historical data to back it up. There is no cause and effect in the short term, and only a small correlation in the long term.

Why does this matter? If the FED and other organisations believe this is true, they also believe that keeping information about rising inflation away from the public is a good thing. Also their numbers might be flawed.

The first thing you will notice with my source is that its from the federal reserve itself. The guy writing this has worked in the federal reserve. So its a good insight into how the models used are flawed, but also the attitude the federal reserve and other similar organisations has in regards to the public, and keeping information hidden.

q7tmr7 submission Bank of England‚Äôs Deputy Governor Says Crypto Collapse Plausible, Regulators Need to Urgently Establish Rules 
hgl5681 comment Fud, they are buying again 
hgky4fy comment > Urgently Establish Rules

I think they should make a rule that every 210,000 blocks, the block reward is halved, effectively putting an upper limit on the money supply.

Then they should add a limit to the block size (say, 1 or 2mb), to make sure mining doesn't become too centralized in the hands of only a few behemoths.

We should also try to aggregate signatures somehow, so that multisignature transactions for layer 2 protocols can be more private. (Maybe wait until November to implement that one!)

Any other ideas we can send their way? 
hgl0fp4 comment Or does he mean that he hopes crypto/bitcoin collapses? 
hgl0s1j comment tldr; Bank of England Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe has said that a collapse in the cryptocurrency market is certainly "plausible" and that regulators worldwide need to pursue crypto rules "as a matter of urgency." He added that cryptocurrencies do not currently pose a threat to the country's financial stability, but there are "very good reasons" to think that this might not be the case for much longer.

hgkxyyd comment [Lightning Addresses are cool](https://lightningaddress.com) 
hglj7gz comment When using a custodial Lightning wallet such as Phoenix, one is given the option to store a mnemonic recovery seed.

What exactly does this phrase allow you to recover? For regular on-chain-only wallets, a seed phrase allows the user to recover the private key as per the BIP39 standard. Do individual Lightning channels have a similar system that utilise a private key to sign transactions? 
hgleys8 comment To the moon and beyond! ‚ö°Ô∏è 
hglv4fz comment Can someone explain why rebalancing would be necessary? Say I open 10 channels with a million sats each. And I'm not sending any of my own sats around. I just want to grow the network right now. 

I feel like I understand lightning decently well, but rebalancing just doesn't make sense to me yet.

hglhsr8 comment Say I have ten 1mill sat channels open and I rebalance and spread my sats around the channels.  I also never spent a sat for purchases.  If I close a particular channel with less than a million sats on my side, due to rebalance, will I get back the million I started with on that channel?  Or will I get back what ever is left in that channel on my side?

q7tp57 submission Energy consumption of mining Bitcoin when it reaches 1 million US per coin 
hgl08t9 comment The trade price has nothing to do with energy to mine 
hgky4u9 comment bitcoin is perfectly energy efficient because the market is perfectly efficient at allocating resources based on price and availability.  every economist knows centrally planned economies aren't efficient. and since bitcoin relies on the free market to allocate resources to its security, bitcoin is as efficient as energy pricing will allow.  perhaps govt subsidies are promoting some extra energy usage, but that's not because of bitcoin.  any excess electricity used in the world, bitcoin or elsewhere, can be directly attributed to govt stimulus, and govt subsidies of energy. remove those 2 factors, and there would be little to complain about with regard to energy usage.  and of course that is setting aside the fact that energy usage is not a measure of environmental damage or anything bad at all, especially considering most of bitcoin's mining energy comes from renewables which should put a sock in the mouth of the ecotard doomsday cult members. 
hgky2cs comment It will still be nothing compared to the energy required to run the legacy financial system globally. 
hgl12jh comment First, the proof of work will not rise linearly with the price because there will be some halvings in between now and then. Also, Bitcoin's mining mobility enables it to use energy that is not practical to use for other purposes like flared gas, excess energy etc.
Secondly, even if that was not the case, the question should be asked if the enormous amount of energy is worth it and/or worth more than other uses we take for granted like laundry dryers and Christmas lighting, both of which currently use more electricity than Bitcoin mining. I think it is. 
hgl4rbo comment From https://www.lynalden.com/bitcoin-energy/#scaling

> If we say it reaches an outrageously high price of one million dollars per coin, for a critically important market capitalization of $20 trillion, with billions of users, then at 0.50% annual security cost, that would be $100 billion, or about 6x as much energy usage as bitcoin was using at an annualized rate in the first half of 2021. This would represent maybe 0.6% of global energy usage, which seems appropriate for a network used by billions of people for multiple purposes, as it would need to be at that point in order to reach such a high value. 
hglgoiu comment Not sure there would be much of a correlation. Assuming you mean more miners would be online if/when value is $1m per BTC? 
hgl5vfx comment That's not really true .. 
hgkyu4n comment The OP asked a different question than a comparison between a free and centralized market 
hgl0tbh comment I hope you are right. I guess only time will tell. 
hgl0vjy comment So I assume you think things like proof of stake are not worth paying attention to or am I wrong?

q7u0ur submission How To Send Bitcoin? Send Crypto To Another Wallet? 
q7u4aj submission How to prove my holding for renting a house 
hglawkg comment The most solid proof-of-ownership is signing a message with the private key of the address that holds your funds.

You could write something like "I, <name>, am in control of the Bitcoin address <address> holding a balance of <balance> BTC. Signed on <date>."

Then you create a cryptographic signature for this message and address. This signature can only be created by someone who controls the private key to this address. The signature changes if the message is changed, so anyone looking to verify it can check that the message matches the signature. They can then look up the address on a blockchain explorer to confirm the balance it holds.

Signing a message with your private key is the gold standard way of proving ownership of a private key / address. The unfortunate aspect is that it is poorly understood by most of the world, so you may need to spend some time convincing the other party that this proves what you say it proves.

hgl0bz3 comment Give them the wallet address, prove your access to said wallet, and tell them to search the blockchain data. Pretty hard to argue at that point. 
hgmgydy comment Do NOT disclose your Bitcoin holdings to anyone!  Do NOT attempt to use Bitcoin as part of any lease application.  This is how Bitcoins get stolen.  If someone knows you have BTC, they may break into your home searching for keys, seed phrases, and hard wallets.  They may even hold you at gun point to get those items.  Keep your mouth shut about owning Bitcoin!!!!!!!!!!

If you need to proof of assets, then sell some BTC and put the cash into a normal bank account.  Show the landlord the bank statement. 
hgl0cx3 comment considering they wouldn't know proof if it slapped them in the face, i'm not sure there is anything you can do.  

there is no way to prove custody of bitcoin without sending it to them or to an escrow agent.  i recommend suggesting the latter. have them suggest a reputable escrow agent, and arrange the proof transaction with them.

q7u8hf submission I get a lot of these emails lately, any truth to this or just a bullshit thing they send to everyone. 
hgl2rf6 comment It's a scam.

The senders of these emails obtain database dumps from hacked websites and they spam the same message to everyone. If the website had particularly poor password security and the hackers were able to obtain the plaintext passwords, the senders will include those to make the email appear more threatening. After all, the more personal info they can provide, the more people will believe the story they're telling.

However, it's all fake, so if you really want videos of yourself doing adult stuff, you'll have to record them yourself :-) 
hgl1a9k comment The level of passive threatening is meant to scare you they gain absolutely nothing from sending all that shit, they just want money ignore them and they will do nothing. They will move onto their next target as money is their only goal.

Mere replacement of climate-unfriendly mined gold to "digital gold" (i.e. a given if you ask me) equates to an additional +$500K per BTC = $1M BTC AT A MINIMUM

q7uznh submission Can't wrap my head around this. Should I not take out profits? 
hgl5i1x comment this is correct. 
hgl6vvn comment Your math is correct. Where you may be going wrong is in your statement, "when the price goes back down to 50k.". This is a common line of thinking among those that think they can magically time the market. Remember, there was someone that sold the last time it was at $1 thinking they would buy back more "when" it went back down (but it didn't).  Also, remember, for every single trade, someone is buying from someone that is selling. Between here and 100k, Billions of dollars will be spent by those that believe that it will never go back to 50k. Some people get lucky for a while, but nobody is able to consistently time the market well enough to come out ahead in the long run. Buy and hodl. 
hglc5fj comment If you are asking these sort of questions it‚Äôs an indicator that DCA and HODL should likely be your strategy.  Leave trading and timing markets up to the experts and focus on earning income to DCA into assets you believe in. 
hglckcm comment Bruh 
hgli4j2 comment You will have 40k Bitcoin but 20k cash. So just spend 10k to buy back ur 0.2 Bitcoin and pocket 10k. Although if it hits 100k I doubt it‚Äôs going back to 50k 
hgl5kld comment Yep your math is correct. But what you're forgetting is that you would have taken out 20k. So in your scenario if it goes up to 100, you take out 20 then the price goes back down to 50. You'd have 40 left but also have 20 in cash = 60. So... you could buy more, would have 1.2 so that when it goes back up to 100k you'd then have 120. Taking profits is never a bad idea, the risk is that you'd miss out on making more profit, as opposed to if you stay in and then risk losing money. 
hgld9mq comment Go back and relearn 2nd grade math and u will get it‚Ä¶ 
hglbkdd comment If you haven‚Äôt done it already. I recommend sitting down and just do your math on paper. If you have problems thinking it through in your head, it may help. 
hgm506p comment I am no accountant, but going from 100 million satoshis to 80 million satoshis sounds like a heavy loss to me. 
hgmakvs comment Stop thinking about money in dollars. The only number that matters is your net worth in BTC.
