q4acms submission 0/3 Confirmations? 
hfx7p3i comment i have no experience with cashapp but maybe you have to wait 5-7 days in the same manner as trying to send a cbpro purchase to a wallet 
hfx7rcj comment Look at mempool.space

This shows how many pending transactions are waiting to be confirmed. People can offer more than you did, and their transaction will confirm before yours.

Your tx should clear in a day or two, or less, depending upon how much you paid for those tx. 
q4afay submission What happens to GBTC when a futures ETF is approved? 
hfxiqv3 comment I‚Äôd think those buying GBTC would want the direct exposure to Bitcoin and not derivatives exposure to it, so GBTC would be largely unaffected. However if a spot ETF comes out and GBTC isn‚Äôt converted fast, perhaps their buyers will dump it for spot ETFs. 
hfyvbpn comment It‚Äôs basically a hedge. I bought it because I can buy it with my retirement account. Worst case you have BTC exposure. Best case you have BTC exposure AND it is approved as ETF OR premium goes back to zero (currently -17% discount) which will likely happen if price goes back up and people jump back in. Basically people invested in GBTC are getting a 17% optionality for 2% annual fee and you can buy it via normal broker (which many non crypto people prefer) 
hfxam79 comment [deleted] 
hfx8h6b comment I heard BTCR was approved today. Supposed to start trading in 3 weeks. We'll see. 
hfzg8o2 comment I agree with this. Remember that even if a futures based ETF brings more of a discount, the chance of GBTC being an ETF itself (with actual holdings, not futures) means that the discount will be eliminated at that time. This will keep buyers interested if the discount increases further. 
hfywr3i comment As far as I know, supply/demand for GBTC is the only driver for trading price.  Is that true?  What's to stop a huge discount from forming upon a huge sell off?  So yeah, great I get a share for cheap. I can't redeem it and I can only sell it in the market.  What keeps the price near parity? 
hfxhz7q comment Why would price decrease (resulting in a discount, not a premium).  Why would the market not then correct, the discount would then create arbitrage somehow, would it not? 
hfxacgb comment [deleted] 
hg1hedi comment It‚Äôs only at a discount because market is down. When market was up it was at premium. ETF will eventually get approved (maybe in 1-2 years) and then discount will disappear.

Yes, this is the input I'm getting also. Ignore all the paid FUD being posted against Bitcoin/Chivo in El Salvador here and in /r/CryptoCurrency .

hfyi28u comment If it's being used so much in El Salvador, how come the country is not listed in the Top Locations of the [Lightning Network Search and Analysis Engine](https://1ml.com/?)? 3 million Salvadorans have downloaded the Chivo app, but somehow Ashburn, Virginia is still the top location with only 394 nodes?

hfxf8gi comment USD is 100% pre-mine with an inflation rate decided by a small group of people and benefiting that same group. I will stick with Bitcoin, thank you very much. 
hfxdgll comment tldr; The current price change of USD is -5.3% and BTC is +400%. Even the most well known crypto is far from becoming stable. With a massive change in price over the past few months, and currency passing through so many hands it will take some time before other country's make BTC legal tender.

hfxelyg comment should always have got in sooner, even if in around 2010 lol 
hfxg4x6 comment Biggest regret is doing any trading at all after I opened a 5x long last July.  
If I'd just sat on it and done nothing I'd have quite a chunk of money. Instead I did a bunch of other stuff that ended up being much less profitable. 
hfxtp5a comment I bought in one lump sum in 2013. My only regret is that I didn't DCA from that point on as well. 
hfxuofe comment If your lump was decent sized there‚Äôs a good chance like 80% of your net worth was in bitcoin at some point. How can you fault yourself for saying ‚Äúok that‚Äôs good enough let‚Äôs diversify into the SNP500.‚Äù 
hfxzizo comment Pretty much. With all the recent money printing, I fear for the health of my index funds. But every time I think of converting some of it into bitcoin, I have to remind myself that it would be overkill.

I'd rather stay diversified.

The only way I can fail at this point is if both crumble at once, but I don't think that's even possible. The failure of USD would surely send Bitcoin to the moon.

Plus, I always have my house to fall back on...

q4b1ap submission El Salvador: Scammers are stealing people's identities to create new Chivo Wallet accounts, inflating usage numbers and stealing their money. 
hfxfx62 comment You say this as if these types of problems don't happen everywhere. Well I've got some shocking news for you. Millions of people recently defrauded the US government out of billions of dollars by filing for PPE and EDD loans using fraudulent information and stolen identities. The US government didn't verify this information before giving these criminals money and now Americans are paying for this with their tax dollars. This just goes to show how poor planning, poor security, and poor verification affects real Americans. 

[Some criminals are even doing this on contraband cell phones from inside of prison and making millions of dollars.](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/three-california-residents-charged-conspiring-defraud-unemployment-insurance-program)

hfxcx57 comment What are you talking about there's an investigation going on? Have you seen or read the news lately? Let's say you scam someone your grandma you used the Identification number she has but you did it on your phone, with your number to have a Sim card you need to give your Identification and get registered you see now they know you use someone else identification and youre gonna get arrested it's not complicated. Thanks for the FUD. 
hfxc2ex comment Because identity theft doesn't exist at all with paper money. 
hfxec3t comment get used to it. if you were stolen from, report the crime and seek justice. this is completely unrelated to bitcoin.

the real "identity theft" is government's system of identity which guarantees your credentials are leaked everywhere unavoidably.    

how do you know the scammers aren't the people posting fake complaints about stolen identity in order to steal their identity?  you believe everything you read on the internet?  

bitcoin doesn't give a shit about bukele. i can see you hate him with vengeance. but bitcoin is the best thing to happen to el salvador probably ever.  it doesn't matter how fucked up the implementation is, or how many people had $30 stolen.  govt can always buy more for them because that's how govt works: when they fuck up, they get a bigger budget to fuck up bigger next time. 
hfxcwfi comment Why did they have to use a state issued wallet? That just sounds like fiat strings with bitcoin as a puppet 
hfyckqt comment Oh well‚Ä¶ anyway‚Ä¶ 
hfya2a7 comment He's just reporting news and the poot execution from the government's part.

He didn't mention anything bad about Bitcoin, or that it's bitcoin's fault.

I don't understand your comment. It's true, but off topic. 
hfxecxd comment Identity theft is not a joke, Jim! Millions of families suffer every year! 
hfxe2r6 comment I think it was done so people who may not be familiar with wallets to have access to btc. I don't believe the el Salvador government had any bad intentions by making that the way to claim the coin given to the citizens but just not well thought out.

q4b5e5 submission I need help for keys creation 
hfxhht0 comment Hey! I remember asking a bunch of people for help with developing Bitcoin wallet software and handling payments/key generation.

I've used bitcoin-lib in the past and a few other tools. Any BIP (followed by a number) is just a name for a protocol standard. 

There's various levels of abstractions to how deep you want to go but if you're handling address/key/payment tracking then you need a way to monitor the blockchain as well as store the address data. 

It might be best to start off with some higher level programming stuff if you're still new to how HD systems work. Anyway I listed some resources that I've used along the way to creating a wallet myself. 

Low Level: (requires technical knowledge)

https://github.com/petertodd/python-bitcoinlib
- Requires lot of technical knowledge but the gold standard

Medium Level: (some abstractions)

https://bitcoinlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
- Major issues with Query Times in third party exchanges and updating wallet balances with HD wallets.

Medium-High Level (mostly abstractions, interface with your node with an API)

https://docs.btcpayserver.org/API/Greenfield/v1/
- Self hosted, need to pay ~30 a month for self-hosting, setup might be complex if you're new to dev-ops and git.


High Level Tools: (completely abstracts it, third party API no setup)

https://www.poof.io/api
 - Free/noncustodial and could set up in a few minutes and simple to generate HD addresses for your wallet. Downside is that its a third party, long-term its better to run your own Bitcoin full node/light client. 

Maybe to try to answer how wallets work, a wallet is a set of addresses. Extended public keys generate all addresses in your wallet in a hierarchal deterministic way but everything can be recovered with your private keys.

UTXOs from each address in your wallet determine the sum of your wallet balance. If you have your own user wallet, you only need maybe 20 addresses or if you want greater privacy, generate a new one for each payment. However, for larger exchanges like Coinbase, they probably need to monitor and track millions/billions of addresses for their wallet.

q4bg7e submission Giving Power Back To The People 
hfxfjh5 comment What they've been doing is:  
* pushing plain old FUD narratives  
* derailing people with shitcoin fantasies  
* tricking people into giving up (or not taking) custody of their own Bitcoins  

Up next, rehypothecation: "paper Bitcoins," just like the paper gold ETFs which have allowed them to suppress the price of gold 
hfxgf0x comment "Return power to the people" This is the government's favorite thing to say, but I have never seen what they have done. 
hfxnmax comment Within the existing framework of the Bitcoin Improvement Process (BIP), governments can already make proposals, and wait to see if they manage to meander through the existing governance process.

These governments are absolutely not invited to impose their laws onto the Bitcoin network.

Just like during the Battle of Afghanistan, where the local Pashtun hill tribes have knocked into the dumb skulls of the NATO occupation forces that they were not allowed to arbitrarily invent new laws because God has made all the laws already, these same governments can expect a similarly negative reaction if they try to impose their notoriously misguided views onto the Bitcoin network and community.

As the ancient Confucian Chinese would say, beware when government action is not covered by the Mandate of Heaven, because in that case, that government will ultimately and inevitably lose the confrontation.

hfxi6zs comment Username does not check out. 
hfxjuyy comment Nearly every alt-coin is a shitcoin. Maybe a handful out of many thousands are not pure scam shitcoins. All the others are pure scam shitcoins.  Most people lack the skills and knowledge to be able to discern the few non-scam coins from the long list of all alt-coins.

Shitcoins are sold to numbskulls who think they're so fucking smart that they're going to discover and buy "the next Bitcoin" early and get rich quick.

Shitcoins are created by scammers to fleece the aforementioned group.

Bitcoin is "the next Bitcoin".

in your profits when Bitcoin is at an all time high in the 80-100k range. Then wait for the next big bitcoin price dip 30-60% and exchange all your stable coins for Bitcoin to maximize your SATs! 
hfxp7iw comment See it all depends on what you want to do.

Many Alt coins are well respected projects and you might want to be one of their supporters and some have very good potential to grow rapidly.

But if this was kind of your investment saving and you want more stable coin go for BTC,

Yet cryptocurrency is one of the riskiest investments there.

Make up your own mind but if you are following money you will keep chasing and jumping from one coin to the other. 
hfz67s4 comment By whom are these shit projects respected would be a good question to ask yourself.   I‚Äôve not met anyone yet who can give me a logical reason any of these shitcoins exist. I wouldn‚Äôt put a nickel of my hard earned money into anything but bitcoin.

hfy5knd comment Author believes Bitcoin won't overtake gold and will not grow more than 10x over the next 10 years. Fine.

Author expects Tesla (TSLA) to "grow exponentially for at least the next decade." That's not saying anything, really. Something can grow at 0.2% per year *exponentially* and still end up only 2.02% higher in 10 years. But he goes on to say, "at worst I predict it will increase about 6x from current price (Oct 09, 2021), and at best 20‚Äì25x over the next 10 years." 

TSLA's current market cap is $777B. That's already more than 3x the market cap of Toyota ($238B), 9x that of GM and 11x that of Ford ($59B). Tesla's market cap is slightly higher than THE REST OF THE WORLD'S AUTOMOTIVE COMPANIES COMBINED (those traded on U.S. markets, that is). Is it overvalued? Let's see ... its P/E ratio is 20x the industry average. TWENTY TIMES. I'm no Warren Buffett, but when something is priced 2000% higher than its competitors, it's quite likely overvalued. 

6x growth from $777B would be $4.662T. 20x-25x would be $15.54T to $19.425T. So this guy thinks Bitcoin's global appeal couldn't possibly grow more to more than ~$10T, but Tesla--which is very likely already overvalued by 5x or 10x and whose gross margin, EBITD margin, revenue per employee, income per employee and most other financial performance statistics are pretty close to industry averages--could easily swell to $15T to $20T?

Not gonna happen. 
hfy9cek comment >In conclusion, I believe it will produce greater returns if I sell my BTC position and invest that capital into Tesla. This decision is predicated upon trading a non-productive asset for a productive asset, and that this productive asset, in my view, has greater upside with less risk over 10 years. This is not to say that BTC is or isn‚Äôt a good investment, but for my situation it is a less intelligent allocation of capital when I could invest that into Tesla. 
hfxixfc comment tldr; In this article, I'll be outlying my thought process on determining whether I should or shouldn't sell my Bitcoin position to buy more Tesla stock. I bought Bitcoin in November 2020, though I‚Äôd been using Bitcoin for many years prior, though this time it was to invest. "I bought bitcoin because I was concerned about inflation and I saw Bitcoin as a worthwhile hedge," I said.

I remember reading that thread ane feeling like the OP clearly had an axe to grind. Makes more sense now. What was more pathetic to me than the OP though was the way in which that subreddit lapped it up and licked his asshole. 
hfy8bnt comment Just like everything else politics, there is no easy yes/no answer to "is Bitcoin succeeding in El Salvador"? Anybody trying to paint a dramatic picture of it being a resounding success/complete failure is just a political actor. Some people genuinely consider it a failure, some consider it a success, I think it's way too early to tell, and nobody is being truly authentic on the internet/media.

The former is implying that making the first million dollars is *harder* than the second million because having a million dollars to put to work will easily grease the wheels of the next million and so on and so forth, getting *easier* with each successive million. 

The latter isn‚Äôt because the disinflationary property of Bitcoin makes it *harder* to get 1 over time.

Last bear, those S9 people were practically giving them away for free. Now they cost like thousand bucks or something. I bought 4 asics last bear market, cost me in TOTAL $700. Now the value of those asics are 50x and I reaped all the value of those mined coins that I accumulated over the bear market. 
hfybchs comment That's what I call cheap electricity!

Mining Bitcoin (supporting the biggest monetary network in the world) is a massive learning curve and I would recommend it to anyone, looking for a new experience. 


>The ones I've been looking at like the   Antminer S9 13.5T / Antminer S9 14T, will take over a year to break even.

The break even point is rapidly moving up & down so it can easily become 6 months or a couple of years. Having a cheap power is what matters more. Noise is another thing to consider. You can't sleep next to the miner so make sure to have a special room to keep it in.


>Maybe, I don't need to get one like a ASIC, I've been wanting a gaming computer for a long time now, with a GTX 3060 or higher

You would have to mine shitcoins as using GPU to mine Bitcoin wouldn't be profitable. Not sure I would go that way these days. The most profitable shitcoin to mine is about to get even more scammy and will be switching from PoW to PoS. That means no more mining and most GPU miners will switch to other shitcoins, making this business unprofitable for most of them. Something I wouldn't touch RN.

Back to the ASCIs. Make sure to DYOR on the seller! A best place to ask is IMHO r/BitcoinMining and **ignore ALL offers over DMs.**

hfy70zn comment That‚Äôs fucked up 
hfy78ye comment tldr; Cryptocurrency exchange Binance has announced that it is terminating some services in South Africa to comply with regulations. The move follows a warning issued by the South African financial regulator that Binance Group was not authorized to give any financial advice or render any intermediary services in the country. South African users will have 90 days to reduce and close their positions for these products.

hfychk5 comment > This move followed a warning issued by the South African financial regulator that Binance Group was not authorized to give any financial advice or render any intermediary services in the country.

In my opinion, Binance has correctly replied that they are not giving financial advice nor rendering intermediate services.

I have checked their buttons, and the warning may vaguely apply to the "margin" and "futures" features, which seem to contain a tutorial on these things.  

Maybe Binance should republish their tutorials on YouTube or similar? In that case, the financial regulator in South Africa will have to raise the matter with the video hosting site, which should in turn, reject their takedown request on grounds of free-speech considerations.

Binance are certainly not operating in or from South Africa, since they do not accept deposits from their users on South African bank accounts.

If the South African regulator does not want South African users to use the Binance site, they should raise the matter with South African users directly, given the fact that a national regulator does not hold jurisdiction over arbitrary websites on the internet.

hfywfng comment Look closely, people. None of these is an actual Bitcoin ETF backed by the underlying asset which would truely be great but don't let yourself fool ya:

The vehicle likely getting approved this month is not a usual ETF. It's a futures ETF that comes with a lot of downsides. You should look into it. It will be a shitshow.

Stay away from it. It has less than nothing to do with actual Bitcoin and is designed to catch investors' attraction just to keep them in distance to **the 'killer investment' itself, which is and will remain Bitcoin.**

Especially this 'future etf' shit brings some flaws which no sane person would expose themselves to. Just deep dive into it and see for yourself.

hfzouba comment Futures-based ETFs aren‚Äôt great but aren‚Äôt awful either, and there‚Äôs a lot of FUD out there especially if you hang out in metals communities that seem more naturally prone to conspiracies.

The idea is just that custody of certain assets, usually commodities, can be complicated or expensive due to specialized requirements. If I wanted to start up an oil ETF that‚Äôs physically backed because it‚Äôs an open-ended fund I‚Äôd need some tanks and a storage facility, and I‚Äôd need to plan for expansion as more people buy into my fund. I‚Äôm not an expert in oil but I also assume it probably doesn‚Äôt like sitting in a tank for years and tends to separate or deteriorate somehow so maybe I need more specialized equipment to counteract that, or I need to regularly cycle my supply, which adds risk with variable prices behind the scenes. All this overhead adds cost to running the ETF. Most people want low-fee ETFs and all the equipment for this and infrastructure/people to do it right costs money, which will drive up your fees and eat into profit.

Contrast this with a futures-based ETF: a few friends of mine and I in an office somewhere can set one up with only expertise in the field, and we don‚Äôt need any specialized equipment, processes, or personnel to handle it all. Instead we buy oil futures (and it‚Äôs easy to grow the ETF by buying more of them) and ‚Äúroll‚Äù them into new futures by selling them to people who actually need oil and buying longer-dated futures when ours are about to expire. In theory it‚Äôs very elegant, but obviously there are issues, primarily around that rolling process, because as the fund gets bigger it can have an outsized impact on the futures market when it needs to sell its expiring futures and buy a new set. In effect it will typically buy them high and sell low, which is obviously inefficient. The question is whether it‚Äôs less efficient than the alternative though.

As much as folks here like to harp about not your keys not your coins, custody of keys is a major risk and liability, especially if you do it at a large scale for billions of dollars worth of customer funds. It‚Äôs not as simple as throwing it on a Ledger or Trezor or engraving it on a piece of metal. You need to be concerned about insider threat in your company, since the coins are bearer instruments and all it takes is for one random developer to put an innocent-looking line of code into production that ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù logs a key that he happens to write down on a piece of paper and take home with him for massive losses to occur and tank the entire fund. This stuff is obviously possible to counteract and design around, but the number of big exchanges and other bitcoin companies that have fucked it up in history should give you a hint that it‚Äôs not easy to custody large volumes of coin where the tiniest mistake can mean permanent massive loss. Responsible custodians know that and understand that it can be done but costs money. Maybe it costs less money than a warehouse full of oil tanks and people to handle them, but the overhead is not trivial and if futures can avoid it altogether, then many people are going to try, even with the widely understood downsides.

Legally, yes. The Bitcoin protocol makes refusing to cooperate a viable option, but it does not change the fact that refusing to cooperate is unhealthy. Most people choose cooperation.

hfyt5k2 comment Coinbase is a good way to start. If you will continue investing, and will be dealing with larger sums, I recommend to try some other platforms/exchanges like Coinbase Pro, or Kraken 
hfyyh8j comment For uk crypto.com and gemini are good because they work well with the uk banks. For crypto.com you can transfer via fps for free and buy bitcoin for 0.3% fee. Binance used to be good but the regulators cut them off from uk fps system. Dont use coinbase, you just paid a 10% fee for that ¬£10 of btc. 

If you are looking to just buy a set amount and slowly accumilate check out coinfloor.co.uk which are now moving accounts to coincorner.com

Also dont be tempted to start trading with your btc. Chances are you will end up with less btc.

Also just checked the fees for coin corner and they go from 1-3% which is crap. I would go with someone else.

q4ja7c submission Bearish Case for Bitcoin? 
hfyy6w1 comment Insert everything that lead up to 1929 stock market crash here. Irrational exuberance and expectation, celebrity endorsement, wild gambling, all-in speculation, all assets allocated to crypto. First slowly, then all at once. 
hg1ar1a comment The only conceivable thing would be an exploitable flaw in the code of the consensus mechanism. But even then, virtually every conceivable theoretical vulnerability (quantum, etc) could only attack the tip of the chain, which means a proper hard fork should be all that‚Äôs needed to defang the attack. So even that would only be a temporary crisis. Satoshi‚Äôs coins moving = temporary crisis. US banning it = temporary crisis. Anything you can think of would only be temporary, would be dealt with, and Bitcoin would grow stronger from the attack. That‚Äôs how anti-fragility works. 

We‚Äôre essentially at the point where there is a large and growing population of people who would die for Bitcoin. That‚Äôs not hyperbole. The state level attack needed to even attempt to root out Bitcoin would require Stalin/Hitler level inhumanity, and there are enough people who would give their lives to resist that level of tyranny so I would consider it virtually impossible. 

The Bitcoin revolution is just fundamentally so peaceful that it can‚Äôt lose. It‚Äôs a once-in-a-millennium upgrade to humanity‚Äôs known consensus protocols, and like Google vs the Dewey Decimal System, or email to real mail, the protocol being improved upon isn‚Äôt even CLOSE to as effective. 

Ultimately, Bitcoin improves nearly everyone‚Äôs life and harms literally no one (bankers losing a privileged status in society isn‚Äôt ‚Äúharm‚Äù, it‚Äôs just being put out of business). Adoption is therefore inevitable.

You will be left holding the bag for any losses.  Last time I looked into insurance, it would take most of not all of the yield so not really possible for big gains while removing lending risk

hfz0vwh comment I really like muun wallet for lightning, and it's non-custodial 
hfzakud comment Here's a great post that I saved regarding LN wallets:

> u/nullama [asked about lightning wallets](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/p60ohh/any_good_lightning_wallets_to_start_with/h9a66ya/), and my response got a little longer than I initially expected. I spend a lot of time researching lightning use cases and current options, so please point out any options I'm missing, as I already know I missed quite a few. I'll do some basic research about your recommendations and then add them to the list!Here's my original comment:
> 
> There are a few nice but custodial options:
> 
> 1. [Wallet of Satoshi](https://walletofsatoshi.com) is the simplest out there.
> 2. [Zebedee](https://zebedee.io) is a pretty cool wallet tailored to the gaming/esports scene. They will even support [Lightning Addresses](https://lightningaddress.com) *very* soon (they're the work of the zebedee CTO after all).
> 3. [Strike](https://strike.me), currently US and El Salvador only, is a great way to pay lightning invoices with fiat. Yes, those lightning invoices can be your own from a different wallet, effectively buying bitcoin incredibly cheaply.
> 4. [Lastbit](https://lastbit.io/), which also acts as an on-/off-ramp, and even has the option for a bitcoin-backed debit card. EU only.
> 5. [Bottlepay](https://bottlepay.com/), which also works like Strike and Lastbit. EU only.
> 6. Default [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/). When using their default LndHub instance, it's custodial. See below for non-custodial options.
> 
> There are a few really simple non-custodial options:
> 
> 1. [Breez](https://breez.technology), which handles channel management for you. Has a few interesting built-in features. Runs an lnd node on your phone.As pointed out by u/whitslack: Breez makes lncli commands directly available to the user, allowing power users to do almost everything that an lnd node lets you do.
> 2. [Phoenix](https://phoenix.acinq.co/), which is very similar to Breez. Developed by [ACINQ](https://acinq.co), and uses eclair as a node.
> 3. [Eclair Mobile](https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair-mobile), which is an app that lets you manually run an eclair node on your phone, like Phoenix does. Doesn't handle channels for you, but allows you to manage your node more deliberately. (recommended by u/whitslack)
> 4. [Muun](https://muun.com/), which is probably the most seamless on-chain + lightning wallet out there.
> 5. [Blixt](https://blixtwallet.github.io/), which is incredibly feature-rich. This requires (or more aptly, *allows* you) to manually manage a full node on your phone. Also building in support for Lightning Addresses.
> 6. [~~BLW~~](https://lightning-wallet.com/)~~, an android-only wallet, which is also fairly feature-rich.~~ (recommended by u/DajZabrij) [BLW is deprecated](https://lightning-wallet.com/posts/blw-is-deprecated/), and replaced by [SBW](https://lightning-wallet.com/) (same URL), the Simple Bitcoin Wallet.
> 
> Then there is the ultimate in self-sovereignty. Running your own node:
> 
> Popular node implementations:
> 
> 1. [lnd](https://github.com/LightningNetwork/lnd), developed by [Lightning Labs](https://lightning.engineering).
> 2. [c-lightning](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning), developed by [Blockstream](https://blockstream.com/lightning/).
> 3. [eclair](https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair), developed by [ACINQ](https://acinq.co).
> 
> You can get a few nice plug&play solutions to simplify setup:
> 
> 1. [RaspiBlitz](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz).
> 2. [Umbrel](https://getumbrel.com/).
> 3. [myNode](https://mynodebtc.com/).
> 
> After setting up your own node, you can connect as many wallets that support it as you want:
> 
> 1. [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io), with a custom LndHub on your own node.
> 2. [Zeus](https://zeusln.app), which works with or without LndHub.
> 3. [Zap](https://zaphq.io/), developed by the guy behind Strike (Note that the iOS version is discontinued and has a security flaw).
> 4. [Spark](https://github.com/shesek/spark-wallet), specifically to interact directly with a c-lightning node. Designed for advanced users, offering a feature set. They're directly sponsored by Blockstream. (recommended by u/hMsats)
> 5. [Electrum](https://electrum.org/#home), for which you can run your own Electrum Server on your node! (recommended by u/1nva11d)

q4k2bl submission JPMorgan and Soros are now into BTC, beware. 
hfz9rwg comment But manipulation it will never be on the scale of gold because Bitcoin is so much more transparent, you can check reserves these companies claim.

Also Bitcoin is so much easier to hold move and store ones self.

For these reasons investors won't accept much fractional reserve from custodians 
hfz696n comment The thing with this is that reality can only be manipulated for so long before reverting to the truth. They would be using fiat to suppress the price and that will only work for a small time. 

Bitcoin is easily deliverable unlike precious metals so this makes paper bitcoin less valuable than paper gold or silver as there is no cost to hold, transport or secure bitcoin. 

The way this would be used to suppress the price would be to sell paper bitcoin creating a lower price to create arbitrage between spot bitcoin and the etf. This would cause selling of bitcoin reducing supply, this only works if there is significant liquid supply to sell. Eventually it would reach a point where all those willing to sell bitcoin for the dollar denominated profits run out of bitcoin. Then we would see massive growth in the price. 
hfznbma comment Your ignorance is showing.  Suppressing the price of bitcoin is like the worst possible idea ever that would backfire on them in a spectacular way.  Why?

The price of BTC is determined by the spot exchanges, not the futures market or ETFs.  If they manage to suppress the spot price of BTC too long, and I'm not saying that they can't, they will create such a supply crisis caused by everyone scooping up cheap bitcoin for self-custody on the spot exchanges that the resulting green God-candle would be legendary. 
hfzc5k6 comment This is why we bitcoiners need to be vigilant in educating everyone we can to buy Bitcoin. 
hfzmkwp comment Remembered when BTC futures were launched and so many people rejoiced thinking the price would skyrocket?  It did the exact opposite.  Heavy manipulation and price suppression.  This ETF is going to be similar. 
hfzmq81 comment All of these commenter are clearly just speculating on future price, not using the coin as currency. An etf doesn't let you buy coffee with lightning. Make this a game they can't win and which undermines fiat (as is the whole point). 
hg07z9f comment Bitcoin is not a government created monopoly this is our first foot up. Bitcoin can be self custodied this is our second foot up. When taken off the exchanges it is verified that this is real bitcoin not paper bitcoin our third foot up. 21 million will ever be produced this is our forth foot up. People aware that government have been suppressing silver and gold markets for years our 5th foot up! GO BITCOIN! 
hfzkven comment You are free to buy BTC (or pretty much any crypto) and do whatever you want with it.  You could have bought it any time over the last 12 years. Who's stopping you? 

Big players are now buying it because it's becoming a mainstream asset... if your invested that's exactly what you want. 
hfz4fui comment I‚Äôve been thinking about the Soros entry. He‚Äôs got enough power and wealth to convince the SEC to approve the Bitcoin etf. In fact he may well already be sure it‚Äôs going to happen. He wouldn‚Äôt make such a large purchase without this knowledge, would he? 
hfzwl0w comment Would the etf be in stock markets? Not crypto exchanges? Because I'm having a hard time trying to understand how they'll be able to manipulate btc price with etfs if one is on block chain and the other on crime (stock market t+2 settlement bs)

These mfs just want their paws on anything and everything

As well as no one besides a financial planner can advise you on what to do with your money. I am also currently purchasing $20 a week on a schedule of BTC.

q4kb5d submission Most individuals who come here for bitcoin related news have heard soundbites from Wall Street related individuals that they're going to "tame" bitcoin. .. 
hfz420w comment nothing, they'll either play by our rules or get rekt like all other investors who think they have any relevant experience in finance 
hfz8g6o comment nothing can be done. we can try to educate people against investing in such schemes but it will probably mostly be in vain, especially for those that gain tax benefits from investing into this instead. 
hfz7fxe comment Wall Street can tame bitcoin via rehopythecation, fractional reserve bitcoining and paper bitcoin. Create ETFS that don't have bitcoin in a 1:1 reserve. Which will effectively "increase supply" and reduce volatility. Wall Street types will make their money from fees, not by hodling bitcoin.

Parrot the importance of owning the underlying asset ad infinitum. 
hfz5u3c comment You're right.  The ETFs will sell hundreds of "paper bitcoins" for every real Bitcoin, just like they've done for gold.  

Bitcoin owners cheering for the ETFs and/or attacking people who encourage self-custody are shooting themselves in the foot. 
hfzihae comment Unlike the dollar you can't actually lend Bitcoin that doesn't exist. 
hfzb67u comment I've thought about this before too and it's kinda a scary question... As far as I know, paper silver and gold were an outgrowth of the fact that those assets are difficult to move, making a piece of paper much easier to trade with. Then once the paper existed, it was only a matter of time before unbacked paper started flooding the market through things like derivatives and fractional reserve, like you mentioned. But I think Bitcoin will differ from gold and silver because it's cheap and easy to move (and the Lightning Network will make it even cheaper and easier). So with BTC, it's reasonable to demand the real thing. As simple and perhaps obvious as this solution is, I think we need to only accept real Bitcoin and encourage others to do the same. 
hfzhedl comment Hallelujah. Preach 
hfz4nk3 comment You just won the award for dumbest comment I have read today.

People upvoting you are either govt. employees or not very bright - possibly both.

It's absolutely hilarious how everyone here is now a bitcoin and financial expert.

Heard of bitcoin a month ago?  Check.  Bought $100 USD of bitcoin? Check!  Do you think you'll retire in 2 months?  Check and double check.

I ask what can be done to counter what is coming and get downvoted.

I have no words for what this place has become.  Honestly, I don't understand how the mods here don't lose their shit on a daily basis at this point.

I don't care in any capacity if I'm downvoted - I don't care about Reddit points.  I'm set for life financially.  I'm asking a question that people should think about.  If you don't want to think about it, don't.  I don't give a fuck.

Keep the downvotes coming.  I'm shooting for at least 20 from you ignorant fuckers.  50 would be preferable.

When Wall Street starts their paper derivative shit, as they always do, and you're sitting there wondering what the hell just happened, I'm going to repost this.

The majority of people who post here think themselves to be geniuses.  I assure you that is not the case.

All of the geniuses responsible for developing bitcoin over the past ~11 years into what it is today left when YOU came here.  They wanted no part of your childish shit. 
hfz9kb0 comment Exactly, wall Street isn't trying to do anything that binance isn't (largely) doing right now.  The best thing to do is educate people to stay away from derivatives (options, futures, ...).  I'm not in favor of derivatives btw and would never put money into one 
hfz9lyj comment This was a question mostly aimed at the devs who lurk here but do not comment as opposed to people have been here for only a relatively shorty period of time.

Posted here so that some people could understand how much of a real concern this should be.

In the simplest terms imaginable, if BTC derivatives are allowed, no Lambo for you.  They will completely destroy and take over bitcoin.
