qf4gvv submission Bitcoin ETF’s Success Could Come at Fundholders’ Expense 
hhxisug comment It will. It's exactly as I've described [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/q4hpcy/z/hg0jm11). These future etfs are a shitshow.

*Buy actual bitcoin, people. It's much more profitable.* 
hhxk81s comment tldr; The first exchange-traded fund based on bitcoin futures is rolling up assets, but traders say the ProShares fund’s structure makes it a sitting duck for “front-running.”

hhyolw3 comment Honestly. Individuals should buy *actual bitcoin*. Even if they'd have to pay some taxes and fees, growth prospects on bitcoin itself will outperform the 'savings' you're told to achieve when having IRAs or 401(k)s. On top, and that is actually the greatest thing, you possess real bitcoin which on the one hand may be a good investment anyways but on the other hand is hard, true sound money you can use to trade for anything you want directly.

If it's anyhow possible for you, go for actual bitcoin. Learn how to securely store and transfer it. It's not that hard and will finally bring freedom and true financial sovereignty. 
qf4nsu submission Stansberry Research interviews the author from the Creature from Jekyll Island 
hhxurla comment I’ve read TCFJI probably 10 times, love when he does interviews. His one critique of Bitcoin is pretty solid too. Most people are participating for profit, he has a great point. But I think he could learn more about Bitcoin and understand that it won’t stop at profit. I think it does have the possibility to make people realize the truth of money and change the world. That’s why I’m in it. 
hhz7dm1 comment What a great guy, full of wisdom and the real truth! Next up, Jim Rickards, Gerald Celente, Robert Kiyosaki and David Icke! 👍 
hhxykkw comment This guy is kind of quacky. 

Towards the end he say electromagnetic radiation is toxic? What? That includes visible light and everything else across the spectrum.  

The final rant alone makes me realize he's probably just a naturophile who's never really connected the dots about how even the things he declares "natural" are themselves artificial human creations. This makes me question if he really has a coherent model of reality in any respect or if he just can't cope with a rapidly changing and horrifically complex society and has to fall back on old ways that are no longer feasible in an environment with modern technology.

At least in terms of mainstream adoption, of course everyone in the space will know Bitcoin is the real store of value etc. 
hi1b42r comment Wow ! It's look amazing .You are doing a great work. 
hi1rd6w comment Sounds a lot like another E Coin I've heard a lot about.

Unlike Bitcoin, with E Coin you have one address.

You can call that address your unique personal identifier.

By looking at zapper.fi you can see everything that address holds and all previous transactions. Great privacy!

Due to the expense of sending "approve" function calls, poorer users opt not to ditch their address for a new one in the name of greater privacy, since doing so involves loading any approvals you already paid for (these can cost $50+ each).

NFT JPGs are not hosted on chain, only an address, Bitcoin has had these for years. Most of the trades are in my opinion sellers selling them to themselves to establish a supposed "last sale price".

Staking makes things worse in a few ways. Some lesser understood are:
* "rewards" are funded by inflation which devalues your coins, making them zero sum
* worse, if you don't meet the minimum to run your own validator node, you lose:
a) custody: delegated staking involves handing over custody to a staking service. Now all you have is an IOU.
b) the ability to transact as you wish: the custodian has final say over what you can do with your money.
c) you get less "rewards" (compensation) for inflation than richer individuals who themselves stake. Every year a percentage of inflation goes straight into the pockets of bank like entities.

My last point: users are participating due to implicit social contracts such as "if it goes wrong the project will make you whole", "if you help our thing look like it has users you might get a reward in the form of a newly minted token" - the contracts themselves you wouldn't want to act in place of a judge (and they don't), since they are nowhere near intelligent enough for the hype.

Bitcoin is incredible, don't get distracted or confused by E Coin.

No.

hhxp2gj comment I believe before 2008 people didn't own 5 or 10 houses, they owned one they couldn't afford. Mortgages were issued to anyone who could sign on the line and then quickly sold earning the originating bank a few hundred bucks. The buyer expected to refinance it kicking their debt down the road as RE prices kept going up. The 5 or 10 houses thing came after the great recession, when airbnb renting grew in popularity. The airbnb hosts had it real nice (I hear) but were bit by covid really hard (I hear). 

Stock market today looks like a joke. Companies with negative EPS triple their market caps in 1 or 2 years. It makes no sense. Perhaps it looked similar to an observer in the late 90's.

Bitcoin has its ebbs and flows and ICOs and new tokens are 90% worthless scams. The narrative about it all being "the future" can be compelling. But bitcoin, as great as it is, hit $4K in march 2020 when people dumped it like stale pizza. That tells me that's no safe heaven and when bigboy dumps, the rest of shit will flow down with it. Things ARE different today but one shall not invest recklessly. The higher the price goes the higher the risk for everyone buying in at that price.

And don't forget the mega hodlers like Saylor's MSTR. Imagine his cocaine batch arrives cut a little differently and he'll decide that XMR is a better coin because it has privacy. Imagine him selling 1000's of coins into a retail demand buying $20 a pop. And that's just one. All those unapproved ETFs holding coin might scrap the ETF plans and also try to exit. Look at order books on exchanges. They are not as deep as you'd think.

TLDR: It's all a shitshow. Be cautious and don't fall asleep at the wheel. 
hhxwd03 comment Currency has value for three reasons. Stability, security, convince. Bitcoin is increasing in how convenient it is and people are starting to value security over stability so I see us going up for a while 
hhxlkoc comment Do you think that there will be a blow off top similar to the last 2 cycles or that bitcoin will stabilize and have less huge swings? or another thought? not trolling, interested in your opinion 
hhxmgoi comment You're asking a short term question.

Short term: **nobody knows**.

Bitcoin is an excellent long term, buy and hold asset for patient investors with strong hands.

Consider using dollar cost averaging.

Eventually we will reach the point where no sane person will exchange a Bitcoin (or a gold coin) for any amount of fiat currency.

Remember: Not your keys, not your Bitcoins.

hhxnf8s comment It depends what you are in it for. Risks with holding but also risks with selling. If it goes up then you won’t have those shares anymore and you will need to buy in at a higher price. If I am investing long term in Bitcoin I wouldn’t try to predict the drops. Maybe some can….who knows but most can’t. Anyways, if you believe crypto can be something in the future then start saving some of it. If you a trying to make a quick buck, then you can try to time the drop and then rebuy.

**my opinion. I don’t know a lot and don’t really understand crypto fully** 
hhxq3y1 comment ...*when the only thing you know about Bitcoin is it's recent price*...

You're talking about two different kinds of money:  
* fiat currency  
* Bitcoin  

Once you've learned a little about what Bitcoin actually is, and the basics of how it works, and when you understand the inherent flaws found in fiat, then you realize that Bitcoin is a **far superior form of money**.  

The USD is going to hell in a hurry, along with every other fiat currency.  Bitcoin is a viable, legitimate, effective alternative to the fiat "shit" currency.  

WHY would anybody want to exchange their good, strong, sound money (Bitcoin) for flimsy failing money?  I would never do that.

hi0970a comment To avoid heat and noise problems, and to fit within the electricity capacity of the average home, a Dorsey miner-for-anybody would need to draw about the same as a laptop, about 100 watts  

Imagine a little box like Dorsey's payment terminal  
https://i.imgur.com/Irde7JS.png  

To have the same energy profitability as its competitors, it would need to burn about 20 Joules per terahash  

Calculator says this means 5TH per second  

By the time the Dorsey miner-for-anybody is available, the Bitcoin global hash rate will be about 800EH per second. If the Dorsey miner-for-anybody is successful, it will double the global hash rate to 1600EH per second  

Divide 5TH into 1600EH and multiply by 37.5 BTC per hour. The Dorsey miner-for-anybody makes about 12 Satoshis per hour. That is, it consumes 0.1 kW-hour to earn $0.007  

If the price is less than $50, it's a fun toy, a useful contribution to the decentralization of mining. It probably won't be completely decentralized. Most users will hook it up to the Dorsey mining pool, and Dorsey will control transaction selection for 50% of the mining network  

Dorsey would need to sell about 40 million devices for this scenario to play out  

If its configuration isn't locked down, users can choose a pool, choose their own transaction selection from their own nodes. Expect non-profit Dorsey-miner pools to spring up  

Possible additional decentralization effect ...  
If 50% of the hash rate can be taken by palm-size devices earning 15 cents per day, with no concern for profit, the 100+ TH devices could become unprofitable, and large mining operations could become obsolete

hhxtq0l comment This will be a revolution. First el salvador. Then latam. Then Africa. Then middle east. The dominoes are going to fall one at a time. 
hhxt02f comment shitcoins of course are a bubble of ephemera 
hhzxoae comment This is actually a good article for those who bother to read it and understand what is being said, rather than kneejerking the usual "he must hate Bitcoin!" or "he mentioned 'crypto' therefore he's a shitcoiner!" nonsense.

OP, it's obvious that we're in an "everything bubble" right now.  One question is, what will come out of it that is still useful after the burst?  Say what you will about bubblenomics, Bitcoin still ends up being useful no matter what its unit price is.  People can still send money home to granny in El Salvador without paying middlemen like Western Union.  Dissidents can get payments to buy food.  Products can be sold internationally at retail because buyers no longer have to send a $150 SWIFT transfer whether buying a $79 toy or a $500,000 industrial manufacturing system.  Digital goods like STLs for 3D printing can be sold in a nearly frictionless internet economy -- no "8% to MasterCard because the seller is in Ireland".  Bitcoin's absolute neutrality means that someone can use it for any purpose, whether legal or illegal, moral or immoral, in favor of or opposed to any current political ideology.  The "social credit score" and "cancel culture" and "deplatforming" have no sway over Bitcoin, and there is much wailing and gnashing of teeth among those who hate that they can't stop it.

So, yes, it's a technological revolution.  When the Everything Bubble falls apart, there isn't any question that the unit price will drop -- because ALL unit prices for everything will drop as the global supply of "money" gets thrown in a dumpster and set on fire -- but when everything settles out, there will still be Bitcoin and people will still use it.

And in the end, I and many others here believe that Bitcoin solves the core problem we have been seeing for the last  couple of decades, which is that central banks keep printing money to bail out crony institutions -- the Cantillon Effect -- and then have to print even more out to paper over the problems that the bailouts caused, and then have to repeat the cycle until hyperinflationary implosion.

Bitcoin can't do that because there is no Central Bankster in control of it.  So, in the long run, whether or not it is harmed during the Great Collapse of the Everything Bubble, I, we, believe it will survive and thrive. 
hhxter4 comment There is Bitcoin, and then there are alt-coins.  

"Crypto-assets" implies alt-coins.  

Nearly every alt-coin is a shitcoin. Maybe a handful out of many thousands are not pure scam shitcoins. All the others are pure scam shitcoins.  Most people lack the skills and knowledge to be able to discern the few non-scam coins from the long list of all alt-coins.

Shitcoins are sold to numbskulls who think they're so fucking smart that they're going to discover and buy "the next Bitcoin" early and get rich quick.

Shitcoins are created by scammers to fleece the aforementioned group.

Bitcoin is "the next Bitcoin".

Bitcoin is a new kind of money; the strongest/best form of money. 
hhxwlik comment tldr; Frontier Friday is a weekly column that explores the implications of a topical issue, driven either by events the week prior, suggestions from readers, or because I had an itch to scratch and thought something was worth exploring. This week, we are exploring technological revolutions and comparing implications of two thinkers whom I admire: Carlota Perez and Ben Thompson. Each share a view that we move through technological revolutions which dramatically shape finance and society.

hhydftg comment Why are there hundreds and hundreds of cryptos down >75% last few years but bitcoin is up over 800+% in same period?

Dont be scammed by 'crypto-assets'.

There's one secure, monetary network and that's bitcoin. It is antifragile, provably scarce, protected by robust network of users running full nodes enforcing the rules, and secured by proof of work. It has withstood years of essentially 'wars' against it at every angle and is battle tested. 

Everything else are built with flaws (insecure governance) and are generally VC, silicon valley, LLC funded trash designed to confuse & distract.

hhyniur comment The big question in my mind is if the peak will be in December again, or in March.

I think a lot of people are expecting the peak to be in December because the last two cycles peaked in December.

However, there is also this pattern to consider:

* The peak of the first cycle was 1 year after the Halvening.
* The peak of the second cycle was 1.5 years after the Halvening.
* Maybe the peak of the third cycle will be 2 years after the Halvening.

So it could be in March.

I'm interested to see how it plays out.

hhy05c1 comment This is awesome, very comprehensive. This should be stickied. 
hhy1gd6 comment tldr; Bitcoin is one of the world’s greatest invention and a once-in-a-lifetime event. The whole world just hasn’t woken up to this fact yet, but it's only a question of time. The truth always prevails and the fallacies of these people will be brought to light with time. Bitcoin can fundamentally change the economics of energy by introducing a highly profitable use of electricity.

What is even more interesting is that Blockfi/Celsius and companies alike do allow you to generate cashflow in exactly the same way such as bonds.

Add that up and that's Bitcoin's market capitalization. Old money clutches their pearls still believing wealth needs to be physical. 
hhz5yxk comment Interestingly it doesn't matter how "high" bitcoin goes in terms of USD valuation, once you realize that fiat is always trending towards 0 in the long term BTC is going to trend always higher and higher. Just as you said keep putting some aside and you'll be good

hhy5zai comment tldr; In a calendar year, the total crypto market capitalization more than quadrupled from $361 billion to more than $1 trillion in January, reaching an all-time high of around $2.6 trillion in May. Volatility of this magnitude in the crypto markets is nothing new, especially for those battle-tested by market cycles of years past. However, volatility can instead serve as an opportunity to gain exposure to assets with high upside potential at a discounted price.

&#x200B;

That was actually the case. I was contacted a few months back by discord asking if I wanted to participate in a Giveaway they were doing. Since I didn't had to give any personal information to participate, I accepted. 

Yesterday they contacted me saying that I've won about 17k USD in bitcoin, but I would had to create an account in that site, that they said was a trader. So, before doing anything, I've decided to research a little bit, and thought that the Bitcoin community would know if the site was legit, since I have no knowledge about it.

Thank you all for the answers.

hhz3850 comment I think you're confusing .org with .com 
qf8rzz submission What is the real purpose of Proof of Work? 
hhya033 comment The second piece that you're missing is: make forgery prohibitively expensive.

Proof of work chooses the winner randomly (proportional to share of hash power) but it also makes it so that an attacker who wants to rewrite history would have to redo all work done since the point they want to change in order to have other miners accept their changes as valid.

If I want to change something that happened 3 blocks ago, not only do I have to redo the "work" (finding new "winning tickets" for the last 3 blocks) I also have to be able to mine blocks on an ongoing basis fast enough to ensure my alternate-history chain remains the longest chain (at least until the block(s) I changed get deep enough) . 

If I cant ensure my version will always be the longest chain, no one else in the network will accept the alternate history as valid because of the longest chain rule. This is why the "51%" threshold for attacking bitcoin is a thing- you need at least 51% of the hash power to, on expectation, be able to maintain the longest chain by yourself. 
hhy88wj comment [The best](https://youtu.be/ZKwqNgG-Sv4) explanation of PoW you’re going to get. 
hhy93e0 comment Basically yes. POW also helps to keep the network decentralized. However it also ensures that internet providers can't rewrite the data on its way to users and it motivates miners to not attack the network. 
hhy97i7 comment PoW by itself is just a way of proving that some work has been done to produce a hash, based on the assumption that the hash algorithm is is collision-resistant and there are no ways to compute a pre-image to reduce the amount of computation required. It must then be the case that a certain hash (or range of hashes) can only be produced via brute force of the message with a nonsense value, which is computationally expensive, but by comparison, verification is much less expensive because it only requires running the algorithm once.

The important ingredient which Bitcoin adds to PoW is the difficulty adjustment. These combined pieces are used to select a winner at random, and importantly, to ensure that at most, only one winner can be picked on average every ~10 minutes. This property is ensured by the laws of thermodynamics, rather than based on the clock of certain computers, which can be manipulated.

Also, the thermodynamic property ensures that somebody who joins the network later can have proof that work has been performed to get the chain to its current state. This property is missing in PoS systems, where you essentially must take the word of the existing participants that it got to this state through honest application of the rules they're given. Since their rules are cheap to compute, they could potentially have done it in much less time than they say they have.

hhy9dkx comment It's not entirely random, you can get better odds by having more powerful hardware that can do more hashes in the same amount of time. 
hhyasux comment I posted the wrong video in previous reply, apologies. You should still watch it (The Trust Machine) though as I personally think it’s the best explanation of bitcoin that exists on YouTube. 

[This](https://youtu.be/b-7dMVcVWgc) covers proof of work extensively and will answer all of your questions. 
hhzd26s comment Nodes without an autorithy making decisions are like ships in an endless dark sea. Incoming PoW blocks shines like a lighthouse in the horizon, where all saylors can follow knowing that they won't collide nor get lost from others because they know everyone is doing the same.  
PoW is the light in the darkness 

It's what enables decentralized coherence.

qf8u85 submission This came up again in a post earlier today so: Let's say every bitcoin has been mined and a single exchange is running with just 1 BTC available for 1 million USD and someone buys it for that... The market cap of bitcoin is now 21 trillion. 21 trillion USD never flowed directly into bitcoin. 
hhy8tmv comment "Realized cap" is a useful metric that makes the true outstanding value of the network a bit more clear. Essentially, instead of applying the current market price to every outstanding unit, value each UTXO at the price at which it last changed hands. 

https://coinmetrics.io/realized-capitalization/ 
hhy6nt8 comment This is true for any market cap. That’s how market cap works. It’s why market caps can be misleading and small coins can be manipulated into showing large market caps. 
hhy6m9i comment yep thats how market cap work and thats the flaw of it.
liquidity is never considered. just like private equity funding. 
hhybyfn comment Yup, this is what people misunderstand when they try to use market cap to set price targets 
hhycoxj comment I think it's hilarious that a post I made a couple weeks ago about instant transfers at Coinbase gets nearly 4k upvotes and yet attempting to clarify misconceptions about market cap gets downvoted.

You should post that separately so it gets more visibility.

hhycjx2 comment Are you guys higher than me right now? Do you not see that I am joking... 
hhyaeh4 comment This is why you need to do research and stick to normal methods like P2P being the safest way to buy or sell crypto. Even decentralised exchanges can have glitches or things that go wrong that effect specific customers/Dex users.

Since many are moving their coins or to buying on DEX not on centralised exchanges this brings with it an abundance of scams and shit servers that show a balance of xyz amount of XYZ coin and ABC coin and 123 coin but they aren’t legit balances rather mimicked exchanges that are for testing purposes which can display xyz coins in the users “account” that contacts you via a message asking for help to transfer their Bitcoin because they have been blocked or say anything like that they can’t move it and need you to accept their BTC or XYZ coin and simply transfer it over to their Other chain address. 
One Red flag.

In reality really all they want is you to make a new account on their fake exchange that is a test net but follows live data and to Open an account where you you have to DEPOSIT Bitcoin (Red Flag) or any other coin to the account you make on a shit exchange which is often 0.1 BTC (asked to send from another exchange huge red flag) while they have sent to your shit exchange account let’s say 0.987 BTC. And it’s sitting there in your account but to access and keep the 25% they say you can keep for helping makes the 0.1 BTC fee worth it as you will get around 0.25 BTC back the only problem is the BTC or any coin sent to you on a shit test net exchange can’t be moved ever only the Devs can move the fake funds around. 

So you decide to buy or get 0.1 BTC if you own it and send it to the test net exchange you think is real then when you send it and “account verified” when you try send the BTC you deposited or that was deposited by the scammer it will prompt you with an error or funds locked or some shit. (Then you realise your scammed)

One rule NEVER should you have to pay to use an exchange ONLY you will need to deposit funds to trade or exchange but this is never in an amount of 0.1 or even 0.01 BTC or any crypto, it’s never in crypto cost it will be like Min $10 or $100 deposit in Any fiat which means it’s  most likely legit. 

Even so ALWAYS RESEARCH AND EXCHANGE YOU USE OR WANT TO OR SOMEONE EVEN FAMILY RECOMMEND. 

I have 0.87 BTC on a test net server that I thought was legit I’m not saying the exchange name but it starts with a Bit in the name and most exchanges with “Bit” in their website or company name are shit scams sure some are legit like Bit Torrent but many are not especially when they are claiming or pretending to be an exchange. 

I recommend anyone here who has had any dodgy stuff go on ever with crypto to read detailed guides on how people scam with crypto AND how people scam online over the internet non crypto related. Not so you can scam but so you know what to expect when you see the scams and then can report them or make sure others realise it’s A scam.

Be safe! Never share your seed phrase or Private keys and keep them on paper off of any technology.

They replace fiat with a cbdc and we start to live in a dystopian authoritarian world where they could then eliminate Bitcoin.

10-20 years later they remove the backing of gold and you have a worthless coercive cbdc that there is no exit from, as it’s programmable by the now authoritarian government.

qf9wht submission Serious Brain Wallet Question 
hhydlbm comment What happens when your brain has a malfunction, like you hit your head and forget a bunch of stuff, including your brain wallets? 
hhyeahs comment Memory is fallible so I wouldnt trust my own memory. Sometimes things that seem obviously memorable can degrade in time and errors can creep in. 

As you say if someone gets your seed they can access your addresses. For that reason Ive set up the 25th word/passphrase on my Nano so that if anyone ever found my seed they would see accounts with zero balances (my passphrase is stored on another site stamped in steel). Some people also keep their passphrase in their password manager. 
hhye7jz comment [deleted] 
hhyeksm comment You can always tell your family that it's in a deposit box. 🤷‍♂️ you do you, I would never trust myself with a brain wallet. 
hhyfhox comment [deleted] 
hhyflhl comment Ugh. That's not how entropy works at all. This is a terrible idea and I don't even know where to start.

in any case, it's like I said: you do you. If you trust yourself go with the brain wallet, but there have been way too many people on here whining that they lost everything because they forgot a password. 
hhyg7ry comment [deleted] 
hhygcnd comment > I am trying to point out the fallacy of the security of a seed phrase protected by a safety deposit box.

I understand the point. Nothing is truly safe and, IMHO anyone getting into a security box is a lot less likely than me forgetting a 24-word passphrase, so personally, I'm not risking it. I also want to be sure people I love are able to figure it out how to get it if something were to happen to me.

hhyfpe1 comment UTXOs & Lightning network:

When I'm sending from on-chain BTC to a lightning channel.

And then using that lightning channel to pay an invoice to someone else (her name Maria) on the lightning network.

When that user, Maria, who gets paid goes back on-chain layer 1 BTC, which UTXO do they (Maria) end up with? Is it just the same subset from what Maria opened with their original channel partner? Just looking for non-technicial explanation of how is it determined - thank you. 
hhyh9qz comment If secure encrypted communication qualifies as a bitcoin question, then:

Are there any server-less (so peer to peer) E2E encrypted popular chat apps?

I'm guessing answer is no - that this is not feasible (without a server). Except perhaps possible and is happening in like Sphinx Chat on lightning network, but this is not yet popular so I think to myself how am I going to get normies like my buddies or families to use that? I'm not (not in the short term, so onto alternatives...):

Then if popular chat **requires** servers, then are there any that are generally considered E2E secure and that don't require a phone number (ie signal)? Recommendations? (I like opensource but i dont being required to provide a phone number)

hhynjvc comment That's just a myth. Here's a reply u/thegreatmuffin [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/qeomod/if_satoshi_nakamoto_himself_had_secretly_mined/hhud611?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) yesterday:


Not true: https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ppwf5u/do_you_think_satoshi_has_an_exit_strategy/hd6piyg/  


That's also not true at all. There were multiple people running nodes/mining right from the beginning. Just a few hours ago there was an interview released with the person who (probably) was the 2nd node on the network, just few hours after the first software version was released: https://stephanlivera.com/episode/314/  

The first version of Bitcoin software didn't even start mining until it was connected to at least one other node, so all that "evidence" you speak about is bs (plz no offense, it's a commonly perpetuated myth/misunderstanding).

hhyqht6 comment tldr; Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto is now among the world's 20 richest people thanks to the recent price surge of the flagship digital asset. The value of Bitcoin spiked to as high as $62,945 before retracing to its current value of around $60,000. Nakamoto could become one of the top 10 richest people in the world if the value of the digital asset were to reach as high

qfbood submission What exchanges should I be looking at? 
hhyn6zr comment There's no official Bitcoin exchange rate. Every exchange has different rate because that's exactly what the buyer & seller agreed on at that time.
You can pay whatever price you're willing to at, might struggle to find a seller if it's too low, though. 
hhyt02e comment swan bitcoin has the best morals if you in the usa but they not an exhange they just sell bitcoin and some services 
hi00epp comment Have you even considered exchanges with your friends and neighbors and customers and vendors?

Everybody seems to be looking for commercial exchanges, instead of just using Bitcoin for what it was designed to do. 
hhyspir comment Look at big exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, Bitstamp, Kraken, Bitfinex, etc... do not trust anyone else.

Check here a good list (more volume is better) https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/

Furthermore do your trading only on those ones, do not put money on unknown exchanges only because they have different (and more profitable) prices. 
hhyzp13 comment Heyy, great question. Exchanges set their own Bitcoin price or exchange rate. It's similar to how foreign exchange companies are able to set their own exchange rates for GBP/EUR/USD etc, and consumers shop around for the rate and service that works best for them.

**Some pointers when looking for an exchange:**

* Do they support the country you reside in? Sounds basic but every exchange supports different countries and you don't want to waste time signing up to find out that services aren't available in your country yet.
* How long has the exchange been established? Think of reputability. Bitcoin is a complex industry to operate in and long-established exchanges will have the knowledge/experience to support their customers with top quality service. 
* What Bitcoin services do they offer? E.g. Can you buy, sell, send and receive Bitcoin or do they only offer buy/sell options. If the latter, you'll only get what's called "exposure" to Bitcoin and not actually own it or be able to withdraw it yourself (this is definitely something to be careful of).
* Are the company's employees active and present online? Bitcoin Twitter and Reddit are two big channels that Bitcoiners go for community support and you'll get a really good flavour of what an exchange is like if their employees are replying/participating in conversations there (and what they say/ how helpful they are of course!). As an example, our team at CoinCorner, including our CEO [Danny](https://twitter.com/CoinCornerDanny), is very active on Twitter offering support, explaining Bitcoin and more. 
* Transparency in the exchange's communications. E.g. You should be able to see a fees page before having to sign up so you can get an idea of what to expect as a customer.

Hope this helps and good luck getting started! :) 
hhyn7at comment Tradingview.com- you can watch several exchanges at once 
hhynht7 comment Go with your gut. 
hhynkqg comment In the USA, the top exchanges by volume and most professional services are Coinbase Pro, Kraken, Gemini, and Paxos.  These are where you will find the best liquidity, and therefore get the best cost overall. 
hhzc08u comment An exchange like Coinbase tends to charge larger fees, so that might be why the price is listed a bit lower.

qfcnkk submission BTC’s trojan horse – the lightning network 
qfco8n submission Lightning Whitepaper 
hhyvlrt comment yes, the 133 MB blocks would be required if 7 billion people were to open two channels per year - with unlimited payments in each of those channels. This was specified in the paper only as a comparison to the **24 GB blocks** (a constant flow of data at **320 Mbps**) that would be needed for 7 billion people to do 2 transactions/day on chain. Let that sink in. Regardless of what people on *The Other Sub* are telling you, on-chain scaling to 7 billion people is simply not doable. 
hhysvdo comment The LN whitepaper was written before other whitepapers and studies that figured out how to optimize this even with the current 4 WU (SegWit Weight Units, theorically about 4MB blocks... practially about 1.5 to 2 MB) which *replaced* the 1MB limit. Things like Channel Factories and Taproot can greatly reduce the footprint of complex transactions like the LN channels openings/closings for example.

Lastly that 153MB figure, if I remember correctly, was removed from the final LN whitepaper, it was only in one draft version. If the authors did this it's most likely because their estimation was not accurate/representative of what LN would need immediately.

EDIT: Oh and since Bitcoin is consensus driven there can still be a block size increase if its participants decide that it is beneficial and technically possible for them in majority. When that will eventually happen the other technological improvements I have mentioned above will multiply their benefits in terms of capacity by many folds on higher layers like LN. 
hhytcud comment Channel factories and IIDs tackle those onboarding problems without increasing the block size. 
hhyuq7t comment Lightning Network whitepaper was written years ago but development didn't stop there. The Bitcoin protocol, the Lightning network protocol, and other second layer protocols are continuously being developed. 

An on-chain transaction will not be required for each lightning channel being opened in the future. 

Do some research on channel factories, sidecar channels, statechains, and inherited IDs. 
hhz7al3 comment Projecting the future based on present technology trends is always a recipe for disaster....in hyperbitcoin future I see BTC as the bedrock asset of value, I see LN (layer 2) as a transfer of wealth between 10s of thousands of Citadels and I see a layer 3 payment solution that is setup between the citizens of each Citadel. 
hi1agbu comment >  one transaction to on-board

* Channel Factories

> and one to go back

* Inherited IDs 
hi1ngy9 comment Not true. Like others have said. Channel factories, aggregation pools, batching, so much innovation to come. It's hard to say something isn't possible with something so new and likely to get solved. It is programmable money and new discoverys are being made every day.

hhz32k5 comment Probably a good idea to see which side blocked it , and contact the relevant department for clearance of the transfer. 

Lotta folks want to blame the banks like they care what you do with your money. The issue is the customers who claim to have been ripped off via these services by fraud because they buy shitcoin, or BITCOIN dipped and they needed the cash for their rent. 

I would say though, CBP is more expensive than Swan Bitcoin and Strike.
