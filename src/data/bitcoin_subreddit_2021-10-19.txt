The trend aligns with the overall bullish market sentiment. However, futures open interest is not yet at its highest levels seen in March and April.

That's not the truth I own 18.51 BTC and the first 50 BTC are lost due to an overlooked mistake.

hh6eji1 comment Just don’t trade in your phone. Keep it. 
hh6fer7 comment Stop being so paranoid lol. Yes, set up your new phone and check your apps and make sure you can access your stuff before you reset the old one.  As for the old device, your carrier won’t even take back the old one unless you wipe it and remove your iCloud account from it. 

Settings>general>transfer or reset. Follow the prompts and done. It’s really fool proof. 

So don’t overthink it. They can’t just magically get access to what you had. 
hh6g7su comment Factory reset, smash, and then burn that fucker to ashes!

What would your rather?  Be over cautious and loose a little in a phone trade in and have the peace of mind, or wake up one day and all your baby Bitcoins are gone? 
hh6jb9x comment Umm wipe the phone after your new one is set up? I don’t get the concern. 
hh6z7zz comment You could store your coins in a hardware wallet, wipe your phone and the sell it. 
hh7krzf comment Iphone uses encryption on all storage, in theory the only thing you need to do is wipe (factory reset?) the phone. That is, if you trust their encryption. 
hh6f9u1 comment That may be the only proper way.  But if there’s a reasonably safe way to do the trade in, I’m hopeful somebody here can describe the method. I can’t be the only one wondering how to best accomplish this. 
hh6qn33 comment So, the way I imagine this happening, I walk into the store with my phone and hand it to them. They copy over my apps, etc and then keep my old phone.  Is this incorrect?
I saw a lady doing this (or at least I think this is what they were doing) when I went in to discuss my trade in value. It got me thinking about the security. 
I’m getting $600 towards the new iphone so it’s not insignificant. I already have a drawer full of my old phones because I’ve never done trade in. They’re paper weights at this point. I’d like the $600 value now for my current phone.

hh6f2fq comment Check out NiceHash. Probably the easiest if you’re new from what I understand. 
hh6f37l comment 1 diamond pick, silk touch 
hh6g9t2 comment Mining is pretty much a full on professional endeavor now and has been for years, you won't really make any money doing it at home. 
hh6hpnr comment You can’t mine Bitcoin with GPUs anymore. To mine bitcoin profitably you’ll need the latest ASIC hardware miners and only a few companies make them.  Good luck trying to get one!! You also can buy them
used but they aren’t as fast and good luck fixing them if they break! 

You also have to consider cooling because an ASIC miner will heat a small room up to high temperatures and finally you have to consider you electrical costs.  Mining uses enough electricity that your electric bill will increase $50-100 per month!

You will also have to join a mining pool if you want to consistently get rewarded but pool fees also cut  into your profits. You will also have to pick mining software which also have fees for using them and optimize it which is weeks of trial and error and asking questions on forums or discord. 

You can search for a mining calculator site to
figure out how long you’ll need to mine to break even and start making a profit! It could take months up to years to start making a profit.

As suggested, Nicehash just lets you pay to use their hardware to mine with but it’s expensive and the profit margins are lower than if you buy your own hardware.

You can also head over to 

https://whattomine.com/

Plug in what hardware you have and your electrical costs and it will tell you what coins are profitable to mine on your hardware.
Usually it requires multiple GPUs to
make a decent profit. . . You won’t be able to use you computer that’s mining to do anything else -  most people have dedicated rigs.

qb0bjm submission GBTC Discount increasing? 
hh6gd21 comment Well, tht's what people are doing. They are actually selling shares and buying spot. 
hh6hvyc comment I’m in the same boat. Own GBTC inside a roth. They are actively trying to convert into a spot. At that time the discount will go away. Who knows when that will happen. Could be a great buying opportunity now. 
hh6m2fb comment Stand by, u/Mark_Bear should pop in momentarily, as he always does with these kinds of posts, and provide his boilerplate comments about the following:

*Wall Street Criminals...*

*Rehypothecation scam...*

*Individuals should by actual Bitcoins...*

For the record: I completely agree with him on his daily mantras on this sub that buying BTC directly and holding in a hardware wallet is the BEST option. But it may not be viable for everyone in all circumstances. With those that already have significant retirement savings in a traditional retirement account, they probably would rather avoid incurring the significant taxes and penalties that would ensue with liquidating their account. I have a Roth IRA where I hold GBTC and hope for a conversion to a spot ETF. One day, a few years hence, I'll be able to pull all that out tax free. 
hh6ijhx comment Trying to wrap my head around this. When it becomes an ETF it will trade on par with spot, no? 
hh6m38x comment There is no lag in pricing. Price of gbtc shares depends on supply and demand for shares. Now there are some large bagholders of shares and not much demand. People waiting for legit etf. If and when those big bags need to exit gbtc.. 
hh6mqmd comment paper bitcoin go down real bitcoin go up

paper bitcoin unpredictable real bitcoin predictable 
hh6k2ti comment Spot as in the actual coin or do you mean something else from the NYSE? 
hh6nvml comment Yes. A trust can’t sell so they can trade at a discount to NAV.

Once they convert, they can sell to trade at spot. I’ll be buying some more GBTC in my 401k and IRA accounts.

GBTC is better than the futures ETFs/BITO because futures negative carry. Matt Kratter/Trader University did a video on it a few days ago. 
hh70p6w comment No one who currently holds gbtc wants to sell at a discount, so they are currently waiting for the possible conversion to etf. After conversion to etf, gbtc will be a better investment as the discount will vanish, and the fee will most likely reduce. So, mostly retail buyers are sitting in their gbtc to see what happens. If conversion becomes a certainty, people will try to buy in at a discount beforehand. 
hh6nui7 comment Interesting!  The amount of daily trading for BTC is much bigger than the daily trading for GBTC.  I generally witness a change in price of BTC and then some seconds or minutes later, GBTC adjusts accordingly.  Lag may be small, but I can see it.

qb11ae submission Am I taking crazy pills? GBTC trading at a 21.5% discount! 
hh6pvxu comment The moment any BTC spot ETF gets approved, that discount is going to evaporate. 
hh6smxi comment I hope it gets approved quick considering my entire retirement fund is GBTC. 
hh79rms comment Yeah it's bad right now. I loaded up on GBTC in my IRA back when it sold at a premium. Pretty annoyed to see the price where it is. 
hh81jii comment Remember, GBTC is a public listing of private shares that have been held by accredited investors for six months. From their standpoint, as long as they can sell the shares for more than they bought in for six or more months ago, they make a profit. It also depends on whether the fund was even open to new investors six months ago. So it’s not going to exactly track the price of Bitcoin, but should go up over the long term if Bitcoin does. Once it converts to real spot ETF, this will change. 
hh719xb comment GBTC also has a 2% yearly fee and is not the only ETF-like option any more. 
hh749qy comment I heard CNBC talking about this heavy discount. Makes me not trust it. I feel like we’re being mislead like they want us to buy and they know something we don’t know 
hh96b5j comment Dude, I am 100% with you.  

IF 

1)  You believe that GBTC will ultimately convert to an ETF, (which Grayscale has publicly stated numerous times and also submitted an application to convert to the SEC).  AND 

2) You are a HODLer

it seems an no-brainer.

&#x200B;

My strategy 

   1) Put all my crypto investments in GBTC, NOT a wallet.

   2) Wait for it to convert to ETF.  (SEC has until end of year to comment on the GBTC ETF application)

   3) Expect that upon conversion to ETF, the price will match that of bitcoin due to arbitrage almost immediately.

   4) Sell GBTC, taking my 20% gain (on top of any bitcoin appreciation)

   5) Move the GBTC revenue into a hardware wallet and HODL.

&#x200B;

Let me know if I'm missing something here.

Also I don't know what RE market you're in but I always run across people that buy a bigger house because their home went up in value. Do they not realize their house wasn't the only one that appreciated? I dont really see the point of celebrating unproductive assets. Either refi + cash out to invest, rent it, move to a lower cost of living place or do something to capture the capital appreciation. Otherwise it's just fuckin numbers on a screen.

hh6nldy comment If it is not backed by bitcoin. That could be disastrous when bitcoin is up by 200% 
hh6pj7f comment It will be zero percent backed by Bitcoin. 
hh6x0b6 comment Paper silver and paper gold can be used to manipulate the price because so few people that want to call out the manipulators can actually take a physical delivery and no one can really know who actually owns what because of its physical nature. Bitcoin has zero problems with delivery and everyone can see where all the bitcoin is, making it much more difficult to claim to have a large amount when you actually have almost none. 
hh6wlfi comment it's not backed. later ones will be.  no it doesn't "inflate the supply of bitcoin" because it's not bitcoin. futures don't perform like bitcoin, and they don't give you any of the benefits of bitcoin. so it's not bitcoin. if bitcoin can be replaced by an etf, then bitcoin is useless to begin with, as is every other asset in the world.

The remainder (Only about 1%-5% of population) would be fairly easy to neutralize at that point with only small pockets of resistance.   Might be 6 months from now. Might be 5 years from now.

hh72yxz comment Based on your numbers, you can consider diversifying _more_ into BTC.  At a minimum target similar allocation to BTC vs passive equities.  But no, not suggesting you sell ETF, just overweight BTC with your new additional investments. 
hh6sam3 comment You are on the right track; Continue what you are doing and you will do great in the long run.

If you want to increase your exposure to crypto, you can DCA more into it along with your fortnightly index fund investments. So, your current $250 investment can be split into crypto and index funds in a proper ratio based on your risk tolerance every time (E.g. $200 to index funds and $50 to crypto). This way you are not selling one for the other and is building a strong portfolio of both stocks and crypto over the long run. 
hh6wj9t comment You’re doing great, son. Keep it up. You’re young and can take time to figure out how markets work, in addition to sizing up your risk tolerance. Could even throw in some hindsight analysis too. 

You seem smart, but I always gotta say - pay attention to taxes, and take advantage of the washed sale rule before it’s no more, if available. 

Advice? Drop fortnight from your vocabulary. 
hh6t2bc comment I’m guessing you make use of tax efficient wrappers in your non-crypto. That’s not to be sniffed at. A 15% overall weighting to crypto is solid but everything depends on your circumstances, risk tolerance, investment time horizons and objectives. To have that level of savings at your age is commendable and it sounds like you’re sensibly going about your savings and investments. You can always adjust where your regular premium goes. As hopefully one day you’ll be able to get crypto exposure in the same way as your index funds. 
hh7dhqp comment OP I'm in the same situation as you, I recently took some money out of my underperforming index funds and put it into BTC. You never know what will happen but I believe the upside potential of BTC is far greater than index funds. I also do not believe that 'volatility' is a reason not to buy more BTC now, yes it goes up and down (sometimes significantly) but the trend up over time cannot be ignored, there is a reason BTC is the best performing asset of the last decade

hh7yrng comment Specific advice depends on your situation and the country you live in.  Find a professional you trust and never be afraid to say 'screw this, I'm taking my money and finding someone else.'

Generally, try to max out what you can into tax qualified accounts: those suckers add up over time and are critical for retirement. 

As for portfolio, there are as many of these as there are chefs in the kitchens of the world.  The ETF you are investing 6k into a year sounds like a solid core position.  If it's a solid core, then you can add other investments, like you've done to BTC, to flesh out your exposure in the direction you think the markets and the world's development is moving. 

There's no magic formula.  Set your plans, automate the investments [DCA], and come back every quarter / half / year to review and adjust.

As for FOMO, you're 25.  Simile,  enjoy this time, and keep some cash handy to enjoy after you invest. Be frugal, but not cheap if that makes sense. 
hh886zo comment I went balls deep and sold my 401K and pretty much all my liquid assets outside of my bank account into bitcoin. Best decision I ever made. Life changing amount of money. 

That doesn't mean i am recommending you to do it. But for me, I am young enough to take that risk. The old ways of index funds are just too slow for me. 
hh6sw9h comment Given your age, I would say you can take more risk - you have time to earn back what you lose, if any. I would probably switch to 60-70% in BTC and remaining in funds, stocks, etc. if I were your age. 

If you really want to FOMO dump into BTC, wait for a bear run - now is probably not a good time when we are close to ATH..

hh6uas3 comment We have a lot of newcomers entering the Bitcoin space recently who are exploring different exchanges and such. Some users are developing a habit of asking if various random websites some complete stranger PM'd them is a scam or not. Sometimes these sites are completely unrelated to Bitcoin. This is not the purpose of r/Bitcoin.

* Do not trust unsolicited messages telling you to check out some shady website.
* Do not trust Discord randos telling you that you won a prize.
* Do not trust anyone who promises guaranteed profits.
* Do not trust website with unpronounceable domain names
* Do not trust anyone claiming to give away free Bitcoin. (YouTube, Twitter, Discord)
* Do not trust anyone claiming they will double however much Bitcoin you send them.
* Do not trust 'pretty girls' on Tinder telling you about new investment opportunities.
* **If you have to ask** if some sketchy website or special offer is a scam, **then it probably is.**

You have to learn to think for yourselves. Recognize that there are many tricksters out there who will go to great lengths to separate you from your Bitcoin. Use your head and stay safe. If you send your Bitcoin to a scammer, it's gone forever. There are no refunds!

Fyi. Transferring Crypto from your personal exchange account to a separate personally owned wallet is not a taxable event. It’s no different than moving cash from your bank account to your personal wallet. Only when the Crypto is “sold”, will a taxable event have occurred.

hh7dgyh comment tldr;  BTC/USD is less than $3,000 away from new all-time highs. The US Securities and Exchange Commission is preparing to approve the first-ever Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) products. Grayscale confirms it will apply to convert its flagship Bitcoin fund product to an ETF. Bitcoin futures-based ETFs will not function as a suitable alternative by definition.

*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.* 
hh7j7qf comment **These future ETFs are an absolute shitshow. And believe it or not, Grayscale ETF won't get an approval anytime soon. Why?**

SEC knows if they approved an *asset-backed quality bitcoin etf*, bitcoin would soar like hell bringing bitcoin to $200k-$400k in a matter of weeks. 

And as you can certainly imagine there are some reasons this is not wanted:

**1) Banksters haven't yet accumulated enough**

**2) Too many unknown whales outthere**

**3) Way too many retail investors with way too much wealth in the end.**


The products getting approval now **have nothing to do with actual bitcoins**. On top they come with heavy [downsides](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/q4hpcy/z/hg0jm11)  I strongly recommend to look into. In fact to me it's quite obvious. Their sole purpose of being created and sold is keeping the crowd as far as possible away from **the actual investment of the millennium, Bitcoin itself**. And while everybody institutional is busy overcoming the remaining hurdles and getting into this derivate shit for their average Joe customers, in the background the privileged quietly and secretly keep stacking actual Bitcoin for highly undervalued prices. Until their greed is satisfied (which will never be) and the future etf bubble of hope pops as well, revealing bitcoins true price in some years. Which will be a lot higher then they'll in between pretend it to be.

This is why I won't stop calling them out. They won't get away with this. They won't fool millions of people out of real bitcoin into some cowshitvalued investment piece of crap. Remember my words. Fiat money's time is running out. And all of these fraudy banksters will fuckin go down with it. Remember my words.

Several countries under US sanctions have reportedly used cryptocurrencies to trade with other countries.

qb6oz2 submission Hybrid but safe way to share seed between ledger and software wallet? 
hh7k85h comment DO NOT DO THIS.

The whole point of hardware is to make sure it never leaves the device. If you do that you might as well not have hardware at all.

Just use a different seed for the software. 
hh7j4ln comment you can't share it safely between hardware and software. once you expose your mnemonic to another machine, it's compromised. that's it. 
hh7lnh2 comment Does not sound like a horrible idea, but it would be better to simply use a different seed phrase (generated by the app you want to use) and also put that in the vault. Then transfer some Bitcoin from  your ledger to your phone. 
hh7kp69 comment If the iPhone wallet app will let you import an extended private key instead of a seed, you can designate a passphrase and/or an account number to make a unique extended private key that serves as a hot wallet (derivable from your seed, but the seed words cannot be determined from the hot wallet's private key).

If the iPhone wallet app requires a seed phrase, then use BIP85 deterministic entropy. Basically, using just an index (0, 1, 2, . . ., just like an account number), you can derive entropy that can be encoded into a new seed phrase. So all you have to remember is that you used BIP85 and the index you used (and the root seed). You don't need to backup the derived seed separately. Read the details here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0085.mediawiki. Play around with it here (not with your actual seed though, obviously): https://iancoleman.io/bip39/ by checking the "Show BIP85" checkbox.

You can save the Ian Coleman website to an HTML file and use it offline. I recommend doing so in Tails OS (booted from a USB drive) to be extra sure you're offline and that the computer doesn't keep anything in memory.

qb759d submission Cash is not long for this world... or is it? 
hh7mepu comment tldr; "Cashless society" has two meanings: A society that prevents you from paying with cash, or a society surveilled to the gills, in which every economic interaction is spied upon, thanks to the privacy and control exploitation possibilities that State-encouraged non-cash payment methods permit. "Cashless" does not imply surveilled. It doesn't imply controlled.

hh7nf0s comment tldr; A 25-year-old man has pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to manufacture, distribute and possess with intent to distribute ketamine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) – commonly known as ecstasy – and Xanax. Binh Thanh Le and two other co-defendants, Steven McCall and Allante Pires, were indicted in June 2019 in federal court following their arrests in March of that year after detectives executed a federal search warrant at a rented commercial storage space in Stoughton.

hh8rsep comment Shocking. Another drug-related Bitcoin crime!

qb7knp submission Is this bullish for us? 
hh7z56f comment Yes very bullish. All those glasses that would normally be released directly to the atmosphere or flared off are instead used to fuel generators that power BTC machines. Once the gasses are burned and sent through catalytic converters they are much better for the environment than flaring or direct release. True environmentalists should be backing this technology since fracking isn't going anywhere so we might as well make it as environmentally friendly as possible.

qb7pvq submission BITO - ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF is live... 
qb7r35 submission Here’s why analysts are saying ‘No FOMO’ ahead of Bitcoin’s ETF launch 
hh7ujcu comment Guess we'll find out shortly 
hh7yd3w comment tldr; Bitcoin is in a tug-of-war at the $61,000 to $62,000 zone ahead of the launch of a ProShares futures-based BTC ETF on October 19. Some analysts warn that a short-term pullback might be in order, "especially after the torrid run from $40,000 just two weeks ago,” which translated into a BTC increase of 50%.

hh8fm0v comment According to Bloomberg, no one cares. 
hh8e7on comment Up 3% 20 minutes in. Curious how this will go from here!

All of the evidence indicates that CME futures act as the first price indicator on direction so we will see if this ends up taking over the lead. 
hh83dg4 comment Stop attempting to fool the people into this kind of shit. No. That's no just the beginning. It's not great or I milestone or anything. Because this shitshow products have less than nothing to do with actual bitcoin. It's a trojan horse trying to reduce the average Joes's exposure to **actual bitcoin.** Which frankly is the *real deal*.


**The truth is these future ETFs are an absolute shitshow. And believe it or not, no truely bitcoin pegged product will get an approval anytime soon. Why?**

SEC knows if they approved an *asset-backed quality bitcoin etf*, bitcoin would soar like hell bringing bitcoin to $200k-$400k in a matter of weeks. 

And as you can certainly imagine there are some reasons this is not wanted:

**1) Banksters haven't yet accumulated enough**

**2) Too many unknown whales outthere**

**3) Way too many retail investors with way too much wealth in the end.**


The products getting approval now **have nothing to do with actual bitcoins**. On top they come with heavy [downsides](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/q4hpcy/z/hg0jm11)  I strongly recommend to look into. In fact to me it's quite obvious. Their sole purpose of being created and sold is keeping the crowd as far as possible away from **the actual investment of the millennium, Bitcoin itself**. And while everybody institutional is busy overcoming the remaining hurdles and getting into this derivate shit for their average Joe customers, in the background the privileged quietly and secretly keep stacking actual Bitcoin for highly undervalued prices. Until their greed is satisfied (which will never be) and the future etf bubble of hope pops as well, revealing bitcoins true price in some years. Which will be a lot higher then they'll in between pretend it to be.

This is why I won't stop calling them out. They won't get away with this. They won't fool millions of people out of real bitcoin into some cowshitvalued investment piece of crap. Remember my words. Fiat money's time is running out. And all of these fraudy banksters will fuckin go down with it. Remember my words.

*People don't be stupid! Keep stacking real bitcoins. And hodl. Sure, they'll fight us...but in the end we'll win*

qb7xxd submission Congressional Budget Office expects 1.2T deficit per year for the coming decade. It's gonna be a lot of money printing, and increase demand for inflation hedges. 
hh80xw9 comment These sorts of estimates are usually based on linear models with some pretty rude assumptions to boot. 
hh90n8v comment How convenient. That's roughly bitcoin's current market cap in additional debt each year for the next 10 years, for a single country. 
hh9sy7i comment Must be nice for the elite to create money with their banks.  Most people mistakenly think the government creates US dollars.  It only maintains the physical bills and coins.  It doesn't create US dollars in any way.  In fact, they owe a ton of money to banks--especially the central bank(federal reserve). 

Our system is beyond corrupt.  

https://youtu.be/JG5c8nhR3LE  

There really isn't much money "printing" at all. 
hh9ii6a comment Remind me again of their track record the past 15 years?? 
hh7twa8 comment This alone will drive massive inflation .  The current national debt is 20T. 10% more debt per year is going to create 10% more inflation at a minimum, but don’t forget the 7T already created in the past 2 years that real world prices haven’t caught up with yet.

Yeahhhh, that's not how that works. 
hh90pcy comment I hate how economists (which isn't real science by the way) try to make a simple concept complicated to hide the truth.  They don't create an bullshit CPI model with variable consumer baskets for our benefit.  Its all a show to try and make people think that creating new money doesn't devalue everyone's dollars.

Total assets held by institutional managers reached $72.3 billion for the week ending Sunday, Oct. 17. Bitcoin products attracted the largest investments at $70 million, marking the fifth consecutive week of inflows.
