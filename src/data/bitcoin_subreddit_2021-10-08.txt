q3m2z3 submission #Bitcoin moves $2.9 million dollars in value around the globe each and every second. 
hftmz41 comment Bitcoin uses the UTXO accounting model so the numbers don't reflect the whole truth.

In the UTXO model if I have 10 BTC and I send you 1 BTC then the model counts it as 10 BTC being "transacted" : 1 btc out and 9 btc back.

Utxo literally means unspent transaction.

hfsnw0v comment It's all bullshit because there is no true measure anymore of economic value.  Can't use gold.  How much is gold worth?  Compared to what currency?  What the fuck does that even mean then?  It means they pick and choose who has what and how much and it's been that way since they started toying with first creating stock market, and then stealing everyone's gold and then saying fuck it, who cares about gold.  Here's our Petro dollars backed by oil and bombs instead.  Now give us whatever we want, here's some money we printed.

hfsnuxf comment [deleted] 
hfsn2fh comment Of course we should get rid of the debt ceiling.  It's a dumb farce designed to be used as a political tool.

I've never heard of anyone who knows how this works that actually believes the debt ceiling (a pretty recent invention) is a good economic tool. 
hfsn0k6 comment I mean they should, it's basically how it is now just without the yearly standoff 

It's purely symbolic 
hft0n64 comment Hesitate to say it bc I don’t know for sure but I’ve heard that everyone in DC knows that the debt ceiling is a joke and will always be raised. I think, if that’s true, it’s bc we can never actually repay the debt owed bc there’s never enough money to pay it all back. Look into fiat/inflationary/fractionalized banking system. 
hfsvnya comment >Can we all just admit that they are making it up know as they go along????

Yes, most humans are, for the most part.

Money is ALL (including Bitcoin) a reification.

You COULD have solved a shit ton of your problems with fiat, but you didn't because of your quibbles over religious economic nonsense.You COULD fix these problems with Bitcoin, but you won't **because of your quibbles over religious economic nonsense**

"Economics" is not a rigorously defined, parsimonious and predictive explanation for anything we observe.   It's as delusional as creationism, astronomy and that book "The Secret"

(edit - should read "astrology" LOL) 
hfsmsv7 comment All of the above 
hft5wca comment TIL a lot of bitcoin don’t understand how arbitrary the debt ceiling policy is. 

Arbitrary policy that allows a minority of politicians to hold the US economy hostage for political points. 

Government debt is a totally different topic which needs to be addressed the ceiling is an arbitrary policy that started during WW1, suspended from 1980 to 1995, then brought back to continue the political game.

hft3fo5 comment > How can you divide that number in half 29 consecutive times without getting a fractional number that pools will not be able to pay to miners

The halving does not affect pools' payments to their members  

Every Bitcoin amount is an integer count of Satoshis. There are no decimals. In the software halving is implemented using a programmer's trick known as bit-shifting. The original reward amout is 5,000,000,000, which is like this in binary  

    0000000000000000000000000000000100101010000001011111001000000000

The current halving period shifts this 3 bits to the right

    0000000000000000000000000000000000100101010000001011111001000000

which is 625,000,000 Satoshis, which is 6.25 BTC  

Every time the right-wise bit-shifting drops a '1' bit off the end, the effect is the same as halving an odd number and rounding down - integer division, no decimals  

There are 11 '1' bits, so eleven of the 33 halvings will be "rounding down"  

See the second table on this page  
https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply

> Does anyone knows the payment per TH that will be paid to miners in 8 halving ahead?

This question makes no sense. The Bitcoin reward per block will be 0.02441406, and the number of blocks will be 144 per day. The hash rate of the mining network is unpredictable 
hfsq33y comment It would depend on how much hashrate there is at that time. 
hfszv0i comment The last whole Bitcoins will be mined in about 2032.  The block reward will then be about 0.78 Bitcoin or 78 million Satoshi.  Gradually then suddenly things will be priced in Satoshi/Sats. 
hft2o1m comment Pools don’t pay miners and I’m not sure you understand how mining works. The sats/TH will vary widely depending on the number of miners in the network, the hash rate of those miners, the difficulty etc etc etc etc 
hfsr973 comment 2140 is the last year 21mil btc are mined? 
hft6v3o comment Thank you for your answer. I already read the info from the link. All clear now. The question mainly was to find out the amount of BTC per TH but is irrelevant due to the reward size per block diminishes a lot while time goes by. 
hfsqe7e comment Probably the adjustment between hash rate and difficulty will adjust the reward per TH accepted. But I still need to see where scenarios can be predicted to see it in a simulation. 
hfsrdr1 comment Yes 
hftre5u comment The reward per block is (every halving cycle) constant, currently at ₿6.25

The hashrate OTOH isn't. It's changing every single minute https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-hashrate.html

You can calculate the amount of BTC per TH in the current second but it won't be the same as last nor next month. 
hfsqryz comment You know how much btc will be paid out then. But you can't know network hashrate. It could be 1000 times what it is now.

The act requires members of Congress to disclose the purchase and sale of individual stocks, bonds and commodity futures within 45 days.

q3mvk3 submission what's a good digital wallet? 
hfsrz60 comment Paper wallets are obsolete. Wallets are about as safe as what they run on. See bitcoin.org. Electrum is a good wallet. 
hfsxbpz comment 1. it's called a software wallet  

2. paper wallet are not recommended anymore. they aren't more convenient, and they create the risk of loss and confusion because people don't know how to use them properly.  they offer zero advantages over using a mnemonic phrase from an open source software wallet.    

3. you don't need a printer. a paper wallet is generated on the screen. you can write the address down. in fact that's recommended over printing it because printers are not secure devices.   but again, paper wallet are not recommended. download and verify an open source wallet like electrum (widely used and tested; and easy to get support for). generate the mnemonic phrase. back it up to paper.  and now you have a fully functional wallet, with countless addresses instead of just one (as you get with a paper wallet) which you can use on any device as long as you have the mnemonic phrase (save the name of the wallet software too. this will reduce potential issues regarding cross-compatibility). 
hft047o comment Electrum

hft5isw comment I recommend using Coinbase Wallet because it has DeFi on it

hfsugtm comment Yes, it’s generally safe.  Every system has trade-offs.  If you legitimately fear for the safety of your home then having a reliable custodian might be a better option than holding your own keys.

Just run the risk assessment of whether you think it’s more likely that your seed phrase gets stolen or destroyed in your house or that your custodian might get hacked or fail you.

You might also look into the option of Multi-signature custodians where you hold one or two keys but need to log into their system to execute a transaction with the 3rd key that they hold. 
hft3w14 comment I promise you a burglar is not looking for a piece of paper with a seed phrase. They are looking for valuables like cash and jewels. Safe deposit box is good unless you are doing illegal activity’s. In that case you don’t want the possibility of being raided and then they access your box then they see you have a piece of paper with phrases. They’ll understand what that is. But at home, whose gonna search for a piece of paper? I say keep it on a metal plate just in case a fire happens. And store that plate somewhere good and unrecognizable. Just my .02 
hfsysv5 comment Safe deposit box at local bank. 
hft5oz3 comment Why don't you take some of the money you'd buy BTC with and purchase a security system, some weapons and some training. You know, means to defend yourself, your family and your home like a man... 
hfsvczr comment You can easily and securely store your Bitcoins in a good hardware wallet, for example, Trezor, Ledger, Coldcard, etc.  

You can buy a hardware wallet with a PIN, which will "brick" itself after a few attempts at brute forcing the PIN.  

Your Bitcoins exist on the ledger, technically, not inside your wallet.  The wallet stores your private keys, which are necessary for sending/spending your Bitcoins.  Thus, as long as you have backed up your seed phrase properly, you can still get to your Bitcoins if your home gets robbed, or burns to the ground, or washed away in a flood, for example.  

The ***last*** thing you'll want to do is store your Bitcoins on somebody else's equipment. 
hft3xhm comment You know, I had the idea to make a small “micro safe” that can store a seed phrase or two, that would be made of metal and screw into the wall stud. 
hfszuie comment 1. get the fuck out of that hellscape. private property is the basis of human civilization.  you're living like an animal.  


2.  they will steal your kraken login the same as they would steal your the keys you have written down.  the bitcoin is not actually stored anywhere. the access to them is. and giving your bitcoin to a custodian just expands the attack surface to twice the size at least. because now you can access your bitcoin and they can access your bitcoin.     

Does nobody have valuables where you live? Do you have a tv or jewelry or a car?    

There are some security measures you can take (aside from leaving or securing and defending your home properly) but they depend on your ability and willingness.  there are multi-sig solutions which can allow you to have the access to your bitcoin split among any number of keys, and therefore any number of locations. for example, you can create a 2-of-2 or 2-of-3 multisig wallet where you give 1 to a trusted friend or relative, and another perhaps in a bank vault or with a paid custodian (there are specific services out there who do this for bitcoin. i think bitgo is one of them who have been around for many years).   another option is to passphrase protect your wallet and hide the passphrase somewhere a thief won't find it (but a place you won't forget).  the passphrase option gives your the added benefit of a "decoy" wallet which you can leave empty or put just enough funds there to fool and appease an attacker who may be coercing you.

hftamss comment because govt was tiny back then, and officials would be hung from stakes if they tried. 
hft2zcv comment Because it was purely a speculative bubble and didn’t largely impact the global economy. 

Whether you like it or not, bailing out the banks was the correct choice, America’s tax payers made a profit on the funds they LOANED to the banks and we also recovered faster than countries that didn’t bail their banks out. Aka, we saved people from suffering by bailing the banks out. Did it have negative consequences? Of course. But overall, it was a good thing for our economy and our people. 
hfuf4sm comment Umm . . . you should learn the history of it.  The whole bubble was caused by government interfering in the futures contracts market.

https://www.economist.com/free-exchange/2013/10/04/was-tulipmania-irrational

> Earl Thompson, formerly of UCLA, takes a different approach. He reckons that the market for tulips was an efficient response to changing financial regulation—in particular, the anticipated government conversion of futures contracts into options contracts. This ruse was dreamt up by government officials, who themselves were keen to make a quick buck from the tulip trade. 

> In plain English, investors who had bought the right to buy tulips in the future were no longer obliged to buy them. If the market price was not high enough for investors’ liking, they could pay a small fine and cancel the contract. The balance between risk and reward in the tulip market was skewed massively in investors’ favour. The inevitable result was a huge increase in tulip options prices (see below right). (The price of options collapsed when the government saw sense and cancelled the contracts.) Spot prices (the price that traders paid for immediate delivery of tulips) and futures prices (the prices that traders would be compelled to pay for future delivery of tulips) were not volatile. And any movement of the spot/futures price was determined by simple supply and demand—the fall-out from the Thirty Years’ War, one of the bloodiest in European history, was one important factor.

> Thompson argued that popular interpretations of tulipmania have failed to distinguish between options and futures. Tulipmania was only a contractual artifact. There was no “mania” at all.

hft4c72 comment Maybe short-term.  Long-term, the bailout sent a very clear message that profits are privatized while losses are socialized. 
hft49fn comment I dunno about the profit, but I heard the bailout funds were repaid. And I agree about bailing out strategically important institutions. However..

AIG got bailed out because it owed money to Goldman Sachs. Henry Paulson, the treasury secretary at the time, did the whole TARP funds and bailed out AIG and others. AIG employees had a huge expensive bash after that. And then AIG paid $10B it owed to Goldman Sachs. Paulson was a CEO at Goldman earlier. Conflict of interest is lost on no one. That kinda shit was why people didn't like the bailout.

Probably TSLA, TWTR, SQ, MSTR and some mining companies like RIOT and MARA. Its an ETF, but its not a Spot Bitcoin ETF.

q3ona1 submission Cold card 
hftuny6 comment You can.  

You do not need a desktop nor a laptop.  In fact, you can move funds off coinbase with just your ColdCard.  You don't technically even need a cellphone, although it's nice because the phone will be able to verify that you have succeeded to move funds.  

I wrote these instructions up for a friend of mine who lives out of his truck and doesn't own a PC.  Sorry a bit long winded but maybe useful to you, too...

     # # # # #

Below I've outlined the steps to get your BTC address from the ColdCard and a watch-only wallet on your phone.  

Recommend you start with a small amount of BTC, USD 25.00 or so, (which today is around 0.0005 BTC or 50K Sats).  Wait a half a day or more for Coinbase to transact on Bitcoin Mainnet and then wait 6+ confirmations.  Transfer larger amounts after that.  

Steps:
-----

1. Setup and initialize your ColdCard.  Choose a pin, generate seed words. CoinKite's documentation explains pretty well how to backup your seed words, etc.  You don't ever need to connect your ColdCard to the internet, nor a PC, just power.  My 2c, firmware updates are neither required nor recommended.

2. Next you'll get your ColdCard to display a QR code representation of the wallet which your phone can scan with its camera (note this is safe because it does not reveal your seed words, private keys, nor anything that is kept safe inside the ColdCard)

A) On your now prepped and initialized ColdCard, navigate to "Address Explorer".

B) Press 4 to start.

C) Select the fourth choice (just above the 5th choice "Account Number") which will be an SegWit Native address, and will start with "bc............."

D) Press 4 to view QR codes.

This first QR code displayed is a public Bitcoin address where you may send funds.

3. Move funds off Coinbase.

At this point you can request Coinbase to send a small amount of BTC to this address.  Be careful to type the address exactly, and double check, because sending from Coinbase will be irreversible.  You can also do step 4 first so you can triple check the BTC address.

TIP: Assuming this transfer works, the next time you can use Coinbase's remember BTC address feature to avoid mistakes.

CONCEPTUAL: Remember you are not physically moving BTC funds to your ColdCard nor to your BlueWallet App.  You are moving the funds to a BTC address which is derived from your seed words.  Presently this just happens to be managed by your ColdCard.  Next we'll use the same to display the BTC address on your phone via the BlueWallet app.   If your phone bricks or your ColdCard dies, you can always manage the same BTC address by initializing another hardware wallet or software wallet from your seed words.  Again we just happen to be using ColdCard and BlueWallet, but technically any wallet could work.

4. Next, you'll scan the QR Code with BlueWallet on your cellphone to watch the same BTC address.

IMPORTANT: Never enter your seed words into BlueWallet.  Because your phone is connected to the internet and could potentially be compromised.

A) Install and launch the BlueWallet app.

B) Click the "+" in the upper right to Add Wallet

C) Click the text at the bottom, "Import wallet"

D) Click the text at the bottom, "Scan or import a file" 

E) Point the camera at the ColdCard display. (You may have to move around and mess with the ambient lighting to successfully scan)

Bluewallet will show a new wallet "Imported Watch-only".  By the way you can view the BTC address on this wallet which is the same address shown with the QR Code on the ColdCard, except it's easier to read, bigger font.  With Bluewallet you can refresh from time to time and watch as the Bitcoin transfers and watch as the confirmations come in. Be patient, as Coinbase can take a while to send and confirm.  With other exchanges, I've seen BTC funds move in a few minutes, where Coinbase I've had to wait overnight.  YMMV.

TIP: If you are doing larger amounts of BTC on Coinbase, then also ideally you should also lock down your Coinbase account login with YubiKeys (for example, buy and register three YubiKeys, use one, and keep the other two for as backups for safekeeping).

I believe the steps I've outlined will get your BTC safely off of Coinbase so you can "hodl".

ADVANCED: With a little more effort you can setup BlueWallet to also spend your BTC, too. Delete your BlueWallet watch-only wallet and recreate as follows:  Use an SD card add wallet by transferring your wallet information instead of by QR code, so you would press 1 instead of 4 on step 2(D) above.  Then you would need to upload the SD card to the cloud via googledrive or dropbox then can load file from BlueWallet.  Now instead of "watch-only" the wallet will display "ColdCard".  After recreating this way you should be able to SPEND where you create an unsigned transaction (aka, PSBT) via BlueWallet that you would shuttle via SD card to be signed by the ColdCard and then shuttle back for broadcasting via BlueWallet.

hft5l7h comment You might be able to plug it into any 5 volt USB power brick. It just needs power to run. You do need to load latest firmware ideally right away, and that goes on microsd card. After then you probably can set it up just using its screen, backup the seed words, and get an address qr to send to.

hfv623b comment Well I can think of a few:

1. Asteroid hits the planet and kills all human life
2. Solar mass ejection washes earth in EMF frying all electronics
3. Magnetic poles reverse washing the earth in EMF frying all electronics

Here are some things that would make it crash to near zero for a while.

1. Fatal flaw (I mean fatal) is discovered in `secp256k1` making it trivially factorable
2. Mathematicians solve the 3000 year mystery of how to trivially factor polynomial curve arithmetic (EC)
3. Mathematicians disprove the Riemann's hypothesis 
4. Someone develops (in stealth) new ASIC orders of magnitude more efficient than existing miners and builds enough to take the lions share of mining.
5. Some state actor secretly coops 51% of the pools for censorship.

Most of these events (except [4] and [5]) would be so cataclysmic that the effect on bitcoin would be the least of your worries.

I put the odds of the end-of-the-world stuff at 0.1%.  I put the odds of any of the other five happening at about 1%

But honestly the most likely is for it to be Taxed to death.  Here's a US example, but you can change the names for your home if you wish.

The Government could make Bitcoin illegal (or impractical) easily with the swipe of a pen.

Enforcing the new status is what is difficult.  Very difficult.

Easiest (and evilest) would just be to do the following:

1. Decree that bitcoin is property of type "crypto"
2. Decree a property tax on all property of type "crypto"
3. Decree the property tax on type "crypto" to be 20% annually
4. Have the IRS enforce the property tax
5. Ask the IRS to review all 2019 taxes for anyone answering "yes" to the HODL question
6. Audit anyone that answered "Yes" in 2019 but didn't pay in 2022

Lying on taxes is a fairly frequent past time, but even if you flee the US, they can always McAfee your ass.

If the above happens, holders of crypto that choose to comply with the law would have to sell 20% of their crypto (by law) every year to pay taxes.

hftmmuk comment But why will he mine it? To accumulate value or to use as a super conductor in some battery project? 
hftmioy comment Interesting take! 
hftwoke comment You are right, but I think an asset of "store of value" has some kind of cycle of how the market value it. I mean when the gold price drops many operations to mine gold are not profitable anymore and over the years because the gold supply would slower grow, the price will adopt to that and rise.
Also if the price increase, then it makes suddenly sense to filter a cubic meter of dirt from the ground for a gramm of gold.
It looks like if you zoom out on a timescale large enough a "store of value" will do only one thing: hold and increase its value

hftpa35 comment The Bitcoin protocol is already strictly enforced through code and consensus. Government regulation is pointless and undesired. Not to mention ineffective. 
hftmlue comment >The crypto community needs to recognize this and needs to work with governments

Nothing prevents a government from submitting a BIP ("Bitcoin Improvement Proposal") and work their way through the approval process.

If their proposal makes sense, it stands a decent chance of getting approved. Next, it could reach the quorum of approving nodes on the Bitcoin network and get rolled out in a general fashion across the network.

In fact, any government could do that today already.

They just need to get used to the trappings and procedures that govern the Bitcoin Improvement process.

If they really want to participate, the very first thing that strikes me, is that they haven't even tried.

Note that most people's improvement proposals are not deemed to be improvements at all. For government-originated "ideas" that is possibly even worse.

Hence, these governments won't be able to manipulate their parliaments into ignorantly voting for something that they clearly do not understand and of which they are clearly unable to predict the unwanted consequences, and then still hope in vain that the Bitcoin community would take their notoriously bad ideas into consideration. It just doesn't work that way.

hftk9p2 comment Export out the private key for the address that has the coins and then import into Electrum wallet and spend from there.

Piece of cake! 
hftmn55 comment Okay so here's a way 

Please do backup your wallet.dat file in multiple places first 

Download bitcoin-qt client on windows 

1) create a folder foo (any name, any directory)

2) copy the file wallet.dat into folder foo and rename the wallet to wallet.dat

3)on the GUI click Window->Console and type into the > field: help loadwallet which will tell you bunch of stuff (you can read it, or skip to next point)

4) type loadwallet /path/to/your/folder/foo (change it to your actual path where folder foo is, on windows eg C:\Users\user\Downloads\foo)

5) wait, just wait for a while 30 mins when done you will see sth like:

    { "name": "/home/user/Downloads/foo/", "warning": "" }

6) got to File->Open Wallet -> foo (your name should be listed here)

7) On the right side there is now a dropdown menu where you can selected your open wallets (if it does not appear you had no other wallet open, also ok)


(Since the wallet is now located in the folder foo and outside the datadir, you might want to close your node and copy the folder into the wallets directory in your datadir; I just wanted to recover the wallet, clean it and send the funds to the default wallet deleting foo anyway) 
hftq3es comment Go to console, type export priv key.

Import the key you get into electrum! 
hftkov9 comment export the wallet.dat and import into Electrum? I tried that and it gave me some really long error. 'electrum wallet open 'cannot read file UnicodeDecodeError('utf-8', b'\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 etc.... :( 
hftmz8a comment u/sahaquil hope this works if not tell me where there's a problem 
hftquks comment That didn't work, showed 0 balance and then did a sweep and Electrum gave me an error. I can clearly see the BTC balance in Bitcoin Core Wallet so not sure what the heck is going on. Trying the method u/sonuishaq67 suggested and seeing if that'll help. 
hftm1ru comment No no. Export the private key of the address which has the balance. Using console:

^(dumpprivkey "address")

And then when you have the private key, you can make a new electrum wallet with that key and spend from there.

:) 
hftpvbh comment trying this now, I'll let you know if its working 
hftr01q comment Paste the address in the block explorer to see if you actually have any coins. I don't think core is synced properly, which is why you might see an unconfirmed balance. 
hftrwfr comment Well that's frustrating says I have 0 BTC and 0 transactions from the address I pasted in but in my transactions on bitcoin-qt I have received amounts from localbitcoin and other exchanges awhile back so it should have transactions there.

Bitcoin wasn't created for you nor me to get rich quick, it's a tool to protect us from oppression, censorship and helps to keep value of our savings, not losing due to inflation.

hfu0isn comment > I am investing money I can't afford to lose

Don't 
hftt4sm comment BTC not for you. In fact crypto and stocks aint for you either based on how you describe your situation.

If quick wins were real we would all be millionarres.

Please be senisible with your money. 
hftxdno comment Please do not do this.  You say you "need" hundreds at least, and also that you "need to take the  money out in 2 weeks".  So either you're a gambler/emotional investor (needing to make hundreds for the investment to be worth it), or you need the hundreds in profit because in 2 week's time you owe **more** than your principal.  Which means if it goes sideways you're still fucked.

I would advise you to honestly look at what you need the money for and calculate your expected value.  Imagine the probability of gain/loss and magnitude of it as a normal distribution in 2 weeks for lack of any better estimate.

If you have $1000 now...

* You need $500 in 2 weeks -> probably it's OK to invest, but have the strength to jump out if the price drops 25% to $750
* You need $1000 in 2 weeks -> don't invest.  It's just as likely to go up as down, and you can't afford down.  Further, if it goes up and you make $100, you only see $70 of it because of taxes (give or take, I do not know your financial situation, 30% is just an easy tax rate in between min and max for short term gains).  So expected value is skewed in the "house's" favor
* You need $1500 in 2 weeks -> DO NOT INVEST.  Your expected value is almost guaranteed to be awful.  If you need to make a $1500 payment, you need to make maybe $700 -- not $500 -- because of taxes.  Bitcoin will **not** go up 70% in 2 weeks.

It is not a popular opinion, but in many cases where you "need" money, if you sit down and realize you just won't have it realistically suddenly alternatives come to mind.  Hotel -> hostel, plane -> bus, restaurant -> cook.  Obviously medical stuff, debts, family emergencies are different, but don't risk money you think you need before exploring alternatives. 
hftsxyj comment Literally no one knows - be careful because price could drop just as easily as moon. With crypto you need to be able to handle substantial short term losses if the price drops, in the expectation of long term gains (and historically we’ve had very good long term gains). Don’t put yourself in a position where a drop causes you financial hardships 
hfttch1 comment This is simply a losing strategy! Never invest money you can't afford to lose and even though we have strong fundamentals supporting the bitcoin market the is always a possibility of market tanking for no apparent reason (which would later be discovered as some tweet or high leverage in markets)...

q3sy31 submission JPMorgan: Institutions Are Rotating Out Of Gold Into Bitcoin As A Better Inflation Hedge 
q3t7n9 submission How to work out tax on bitcoin (France) 
hftyds9 comment > I don't really want to use the Koinly app

Any reason for that?, it's by far the easiest way of calculating your tax, [they have all the French taxation rules in there](https://koinly.io/guides/crypto-tax-france/).

You can just import CSV files of your transactions, you don't have to provide any identity information to koinly, if you're worried about that.

Otherwise, you can just do it manually, following the tax rules in France. 
hftykll comment You pay capital gains taxes when you sell your Bitcoin / cryptocurrency. Buying or holding Bitcoin is not taxed.

When you sell, you are taxed on your gains, so the difference between purchase price and sale price. So if you bought EUR 1000 worth of BTC and sold it for EUR 2000, you're liable for tax on EUR 1000. At the 30% rate, that's EUR 300.

You should keep records of your trades, so that you can accurately calculate your gains and have evidence to support your declaration.

Note that if your gains in 1 year are less than EUR 305, you don't have to pay anything. This is a threshold value, not a deduction, so while for EUR 305 of gains you pay nothing, for EUR 306 of gains you immediately pay EUR 92. 
hfu1w8c comment You fucked up, you have to pay 30% of gains on the whole first sale, then you purchased Bitcoin so you will be taxed 30% of gains on a second sale 
hftyzme comment How do I do that (import CSV files)? 
hfuuqqc comment So it's not a tax on total profits in the year, it's taxed for each transaction? So if I finish the year in loss, I still pay tax on the withdrawals? 
hfu5xr7 comment But I only cashed into fiat once. So I pay 30% of the first sale and the second transaction is irrelevant, right? 
hftzakw comment First get the files, from an exchange they would usually have an option to export your transactions to a CSV file. From a wallet you'll have the same option. For example in Electrum you just go to Wallet->History->Export.

In koinly create a new wallet, with any name, and then click on Import File. Put the file there and it will create all the transactions. Do this for every exchange and wallet you have and koinly will show you the whole thing mixed together. 
hfuwckd comment As I understand it, you can deduct losses, but only within the same tax year and you can't get a refund if you net profit is negative.

So if you buy for 1000, sell for 2000, then buy for 1500 and sell for 1000, you've closed 2 trades: 1 with a profit of 1000 and one with a loss of 500. You pay taxes over 1000 - 500 = 500.

If you buy for 2000, then sell for 1000, then buy for 1500 and sell for 2000, you've also closed 2 trades, with a net profit of -500. You pay 0 taxes, but you also don't get anything back. In addition, you can't carry over the loss to another tax year to compensate against gains in that year.

This inability to carry over a loss can play a role when trading around the end of the year. Suppose that earlier in the year you made a poor trade and ended up with a EUR 1000 loss. But you've since entered into a new position that is sitting at a EUR 1000 profit, but that you haven't sold. If you keep your coins past the end of the year, your loss won't be taxed and you lose your ability to use that loss to offset a gain. But if you sell your coins before the end of the year, the gain of EUR 1000 is offset by the loss and you don't pay tax over it. You then buy back the coins at more or less the same price. But now your entry price point is higher, which means any future tax liability is reduced. 
hfuawfc comment the second is irrelevant except if you used some money from the first sale that's meant for la direction des impôts

hfv8171 comment PlanB showed that a 99% cash and 1% bitcoin portfolio outperformed stocks with lower risk.

This assumes frequent rebalancing (i think annual)

The lower risk comes from the fact that the maximum loss from a bitcoin crash is 1% of your portfolio

q3td4w submission What are the arguments against bitcoin in the future? 
hftyztc comment > Since governments hate bitcoin so much (it devalues FIAT currency),

Bitcoin doesn't devalue fiat currency, it's the own government that prints more money that devalues fiat.

> governments will work toghether to destroy the whole thing. 

You can't destroy Bitcoin, unless you destroy the Internet with it.

> And that no matter how good and beneficial the technology behind bitcoin is, and that more and more people are buying in, the bitcoin market would still be ran by whale wallets, which are always at the mercy of the goverment.

Short term fluctuations in price can be anything.

> As the needs to launder money go down, bitcoin will also loses its value

[Bitcoin is used less than fiat in terms of illegal activities](https://www.forbes.com/sites/haileylennon/2021/01/19/the-false-narrative-of-bitcoins-role-in-illicit-activity/). Makes sense since in Bitcoin every transaction remains public, forever, whereas that's not the case with fiat.

> In 2020, the criminal share of all cryptocurrency activity fell to just 0.34% .
> 
> According to the UN, it is estimated that between 2% and 5% of global GDP ($1.6 to $4 trillion) annually is connected with money laundering and illicit activity.

Here are some answers to the typical criticisms of Bitcoin:

https://www.bitcoinisdead.org/well-actually 
hftzwbe comment I think the main argument against Bitcoin is that not everyone will be able to be their own bank, so they would require some kind of intermediary to manage their Bitcoins, which kinda defeats the purpose of it.

But I reckon not everyone has to have full control of their finances... 
hfu68wv comment Maybe y’all should use game theory in your discussions instead of just predicting random shit.  If you look at motivations you might get a bit further than just guessing. 
hfuyo5n comment Read the sovereign individual. It's about the falling returns from the governments  use of violence (force). Technology and the evolution of cyberspace (cryptography and the dematerialization of industry) has made it much harder to enforce the states will, to collect taxes and seize value. For example look at tax havens or city states offering more freedom for entrepreneurs (like Singapore). It predicts a world where governments splinter into micro communities that have much more limited reach. This is the book that predicted something like bitcoin in 1999. 
hfv88si comment I 100% agree with your boss, but there is one aspect that he is overlooking.  The consent of the governed.  Most of the time governments either enforce rules that the public is kinda "Mehh" about, or they shove something down the peoples throats.  In the latter case, it has to be done in a totalitarian regime.

So either the public needs to stay "mehh" about bitcoin, or the world needs to tend towards totalitarianism.  I actually think that nether of those assumptions hold as to zoom out over time.  500 years ago most of the planet was totalitarian.  Today a good percentage is democratic and trending more democratic.

So when a non-totalitarian regime tries to do something that piss off the governed, the people say "fuck off".  For historical reference, see prohibition in the US in the early 20th century.

hfuobxv comment There is no Nobel prize for economics.

It’s a scam by a bank!

The Nobel prizes were created by Alfred Nobel and he did not create one for economics. That prize was created decades later by the Swedish Riksbank, when Alfred was long dead. It isn’t even called Nobel Prize (officially) because they have no rights to this name (and the actual Nobel prize organisation is against it). It is called something lame like „prize in memory of Alfred Nobel“ - obviously meant to ride on the coattails of the real Nobel prize.

And it worked too! Even here in this bank-hating sub, people think it’s a real Nobel prize and aren’t aware it’s just another rip off by a bank!

I guess Nakamoto would not really want this prize. 
hfu8duz comment Nah it's gonna go to someone who lobbied enough

hfupsxo comment Market cap just means the last sale price x the total number of coins.  Therefore, the market cap can go as high as people are willing to take it.  It is completely possible, especially with BTC, because there is nothing tethering it to a real world value, when compared to traditional stocks.  Its just supply and demand.  It is not effected by the weather, or shipping, or supply chains, or store closures, or overhead.  It does not function like a traditional stock/company.  Therefore, the sky is truly the limit.  Its just a matter of if/when.

edit: I think [this](https://support.bitmain.com/hc/article_attachments/900001600583/TIM__20200602152709.jpg) is the specific one you need. 
hfu1gvz comment Try to call the zoll, prolly annoying but that should work - or even contact bitmain, that’s the first thing I would try to do 
hfu2fga comment That will be difficult without a valid Declaration of conformity. Another option: Import to Switzerland, since it is not EU. And "manual" export to Germany ;)

q3u8me submission Former Treasury Secretary Compares Stablecoins to Casino Chips….Is this bullish for BTC?
