qd4x31 submission Great interview with Michael Saylor with James from Invest Answers! 
hhkfy42 comment It was good.  The question at the end was the most intriguing.  I like when interviewers take a detour off the main topic, let the interviewee vamp about whatever off topic thing they want to talk about and we get to see a different side of them.  His answer helps explain why education seems so important to him, at least that was my interpretation. 
hhk5z15 comment Has to be one of my fav crypto podcast ever.

James is incredibly humble, and comes in very well prepared like always. He gets along with Michael very well.

On the other hand I just love hearing about Michael Saylor and his insight always. 

The way he explains something is sometimes a long path, but once you get it, it just makes so much sense.

He really knows what's important and act upon it. I am just surprised he didn't mention El Salvador more and how the South America continent are all just waiting to see how it turns out. 
hhns4s2 comment That was great.  I would have watched it all even if i wasn't at work.  

Never fails listening to Saylor and wanting to buy more BTC going hand in hand.

hhke0v3 comment IDK but could you imagine if you bought at $8200 and they honored it. Holy shit. I’m curious if anybody was able to buy for that brief minute. Shit, you could’ve turned $10k into $65k in literally a minute and 30 seconds. Damn!

hhkjkxu comment Unregulated market that can see the order book...what do you think will happen 
hhk9b18 comment None of this. If anything, a technical glitch that happens with stocks from time to time as well. Idk how crypto in general will handle such things, since the regulation is nonexistent for the most part, but with stock trades that go off way outside the inside market (best bid/best ask) more than a certain % will just get broken and reversed, i.e. as if they never happened. 
hhk9e4y comment You must specify which binance. There are 2.

Every market order is market manipulation. Don't say it ever again. It's like fart in the wind, pointless phrase. Makes anyone who says it look like 75 IQ fucktard.

Nobody gives anyone huge discounts in the high demand market. Forget that idea.

Anyone trading knows the risks. Stay the duck out if you are afraid of big bad institutions who are after your orders. Hilarious. 
hhkb87w comment If anyone doesn’t think the central and big banks are manipulating crypto they are crazy. Look at the board members of the big exchanges. All big bank, financial guys. Central banks can turn off crypto at any time and it’s a threat to their currencies so why don’t they?? Because they already own it. It’s all a game. And they won it before we even knew we were playing it.

hhk8tzi comment What 
hhk9flb comment Bitcoins importance is 1. Bringing blockchain and crypto mainstream and 2. A completely decentralized store of value that cannot be manipulated 

Bitcoin is a nice middle finger to banks and very centralized governments, Bitcoin gives people power to own their money and not let it be frozen/seized. 
hhk9ajv comment It’s the symbol of faith 
hhkajaf comment When you buy something using cash at a retailer, like Starbucks, your transaction is between you and Starbucks. Nobody in the middle to approve or deny your transaction. 

When you buy using your bank card your bank knows who you are buying from and how much the purchase is for. The bank can deny at their discretion. 

Bitcoin is like cash because it's a transaction between you and another entity -- there is nobody to approve or deny your transaction. It's also like a bank card because it's electronic.

hhobl3m comment Bitcoin doesn't have accounts. Are you using an actual wallet? 
hhon1z1 comment Where did you "deposit" the coin to? Was it another wallet that you control?

As far as the number of inputs and outputs, take a look at the concept of a [change address](https://support.bitpay.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003063823-What-is-a-bitcoin-change-address-) 
hhq61z0 comment These transactions are 4 years old. The address is not yours. So it's a waste of your time asking the question, and a waste of our time answering you 
hj4uhxv comment The first transaction is your deposit at [Bittrex.com](https://Bittrex.com) exchange. The second is an internal consolidation within the Bittrex exchange. 

So log into your Bittrex account and then you'll see in the balance and transaction history if you still have a credit or otherwise what happened with your 0.3xxx BTC. 
hhomj4r comment By accounts I mean address / wallets. The address I put in OP is the address I sent coin to from Coinbase, based on my coinbase history. After that, I have no clue where it was sent because the transactions aren't clear.

There is no output which states the .3674... Btc was received by a certain address. I'll edit the OP. 
hhqj2kp comment I'm pretty confident I sent from coinbase to a wallet (address in OP). That transaction appears to be very simple.

From that address, I'm not sure where it was emptied because of how big that transaction is. I can't remember ever doing anything with that wallet.

If another commenter is correct, the coin was sent to an exchange. Most likely, I was stupid about creating my wallet, and someone took my shit to their own exchange account. 
hj7pkgg comment I checked just to be sure, but it's not the case. I bought btc with coinbase, and my coinbase transaction history matches the simpler trxn from transaction history shown in the Blockchain. 

I think I sent it to an electrum desktop wallet, and I'm pretty sure I was phished by electrum pro. I didn't know about the phishing scam then, and I'd bet I fell for it.

It was 2017, and I vaguely remember cursing myself for screwing up a self-managed wallet. I probably checked my wallet a month or so later, realized it was empty, and tossed my recovery stuff. That would explain why I can't find any codes to access the wallet with that address in the coinbase trxn. 
hhonin1 comment K you failed to answer so I'll make assumptions. 12WM address is not your wallet address, it's an exchange account address. You don't own keys to it. Exchange can spend from it whenever they want. They combined 90+ inputs to process withdrawals for 4 people, assuming 5th is a change address. 
hj9qaxy comment I assume you remember right, because the second transaction doesn't look like n Electrum wallet transaction from an end user.

You might ask law enforcement to clarify with Bittrex who owns the deposit address and then either Bittrex confirms it's their transaction or not. If yes then the police can ask the Bittrex client why he got the bitcoin from your wallet. If it was a scam then it might be that this person is already well known because other people traced him (which was very easy in your case so he was not putting efforts to stay private). 
hhox5yy comment I assumed I sent the btc to a private wallet (idk why I'd move it from coinbase to another exchange), but your explanation makes more sense of the transaction details. I couldn't understand why emptying a private address would result in a transaction filled with 91 other movements.

I'm still probably out that bitcoin. Whatever information I took down, it clearly wasn't good enough because I'm not sure where that btc is. It's not obvious which address would now house that btc, and I've got access to all of my exchange accounts, none of which house that amount of btc.

Ah well. Thank you so much for shedding some light on those trxn details. 
qd6rcr submission International travel policies? 
hhki3zt comment Bitcoin wallets do not hold bitcoins.  They hold keys.  Think of them as keychains to safety deposit boxes that exist on the internet. 
hhki5sl comment Bitcoins aren't in the wallet. You aren't carrying bitcoins. 
hhkjmwm comment it's better than funny. bitcoin will save countless lives by allowing people to move out of war zones, and avoid and impending genocide with all of their wealth intact, and even when the borders are tightly controlled. its the first fungible asset you can store in your mind, completely safe from those who would want to take it from you. 
hhkq83m comment Frankly, I would not carry them personally. One day when I get to that point and can live off my BTC, I would prefer to move some to an exchange so that I use it during the travel, rather than risk losing or being mugged for the wallet. I am sure the bad guys  out there are also brushing up on how Ledger and Tezos look, so that they can target the people who carry them.

But the point is valid, crypto is shifting paradigms in many ways. 
hhkqtk4 comment You're not moving any money really, just the private key.

The closest in legacy finance would be having the money in a bank account, and you're carrying the knowledge of the password to access it, not the money itself.

qd7804 submission Where to store hardware wallet, PIN & seed phrase? 
hhkpp1d comment In your butt. 
hhkt2de comment Your hardware should be somewhat accessible since you use it to make transactions. So something like locked in a safe. Your pin protects your hardware wallet from physical access so memorize it. If you forget, don’t worry since you can always reset your hardware wallet and restore it with your seed.

Your seed the most important thing to secure.

There are [commonly looked places where not to hide your seed](https://www.blockplate.com/blogs/blockplate/hiding-your-bitcoin-wallet-seed-phrase).

A [good hiding place](https://www.blockplate.com/blogs/blockplate/where-to-store-your-seed-phrase) is

* Accessible to be able to check the contents or obtain in a hurry
* Memorable in the sense of it being in a unique location or somewhere you make a point to regularly check on a schedule
* Permanent or relatively difficult to move (someone can just take an entire safe if it’s small/light enough)
* Controlled by you so others don’t stumble upon it by accident
* Durable and safe from the elements (floods, fire, deterioration, etc)
* Not likely to be thrown away. It shouldn’t be seen as trash and in a place that’s cleaned often (like that junk drawer)
* Not near your other valuables. Because clearly, it’s now valuable by association.

When in doubt you can always [add a passphrase](https://www.blockplate.com/blogs/blockplate/what-is-a-bip39-passphrase) too.

If you’re interested in more tips, check us over at /r/seedstorage 
hhkm8dj comment Under the mattress, next to the cash 
hhlpzxk comment The device is meant to be the used safely, while the PIN and especially the seed words are meant to be super secretly and safely hidden.

PIN needs to be safely hidden because as you said if someone takes the device, they only need the PIN.

The seed words should be hidden even more safely because a thief doesn't even need your device with it to steal from you, so even if you jsut input the seed into a computer and a hacker on the other side of the world gets his hands on it they can vacuum your wallet. So don't ever put you seed words into anything electronic. You should not put your PIN anywhere either, but at least that needs the physicayl access to your device as well if it gets hacked.

The device does not need to be locked away as long as you keep your PIN safe. It's already guarding your seed safely by itself behind the PIN. People who say you need to lock the device in a safe as well are completely missing the point and function of hardware wallets (or they don't trust the hardware level security of the device itself).

So in a nutshell the only ways to lose your coins stolen from a HW wallet are:

1. Any malicious human or computer in the world getting their hand on your seed words (don't ever type them into a computer under any circumstances! No photos!).
2. Any malicious human getting their hands on your device AND ALSO knowing your PIN.
3. You getting scammed to give your coins away to a scammer (like sending to scam giveaways, or not verifing the addresses and values on the device before you send them when some malware switches them to some scammer's address).
4. You losing your pin or your device getting broken AND you losing your seed words at the same time.

hhkosra comment Keep in mind these orders are usually only partially filled.   Order 12000 and receive only 1000 is a real possibility. 
hhl3gk6 comment I’m excited to see how much faster the bitcoin network becomes with the addition of all of this new capacity. 
  
I wonder what it’s like seeing stories like this if you’re a miner. Anyone else adding capacity automatically means you’ll make less money.  There are only so many coins minted in a day. Whether it’s two guys in a basement or ten million ASIC miners. 
hhl26hd comment tldr; Hut 8 Mining Corp. (Nasdaq: HUT) has executed on a $58.7 million USD purchase of 12,000 new MicroBT miners from Inchigle Technology Hong Kong Limited, representing a cost of approximately $50/Terahash, with aggregate incremental production of 1.17 EH/s. The miners are expected to be delivered starting in January 2022, at a delivery rate of approximately 1,000 machines per month.

*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.* 
hhl8bay comment So if these average 100 Tera h/s, this will add 1.2 Exa h/s to their mining capacity. Delivered over 1 year.

hhmfgcx comment If you read the release, it’s 1000 delivered in jan and then 1000 a month every month after that. Hut is actually one of the more realistic miners in terms of their announcements and not over promise/under delivering 
hhlwqs8 comment Forgive my ignorance, how does adding extra hash rate increase network speed? Isn’t the algorithm made to decrease speed with increased hash rate? IE increase difficulty to ensure a 10 minute block? I don’t have a great understanding of how the network can be faster. 
hhnthgz comment I’m just saying that Miners globally are only receiving partially filled orders on new machines.  That’s all.  I love HUT but I cut any forecast on a purchase like this by 75% given the current supply challenges Miners are facing.

qd7w2n submission Is there any risk of a company or group developing a proprietary and vastly superior bitcoin miner that out competes every existing technology? 
hhkrafy comment There are businesses that have been making miners for years now, with a wealth of knowledge under their belts as to what works best and what doesn’t and they are likely researching ways to eek out any sort of advantage. 

To think some entity would fly under the radar and outcompete them is laughable, much less contribute enough hashrate to undermine the network. 

Barring some crazy technical achievement, which likely wouldn’t be secret because it very well wouldn’t even be discovered or developed by an entity that could turn around and point it at mining Bitcoin right away, the answer is no. 
hhkqay2 comment if someone attacks the network, the network will defend itself.  we're not helpless to watch it happen. the approach to defense would depend on the nature of the attack.

hhkxwin comment Any device connected to the internet can get compromised.

Although the private keys are safe in the hardware wallet your device might still have malware.

This means that, for example, an attacker could swap an address you copy pasted with another one that they control.

Always double check the address you're sending money to.

hhmsxt0 comment Yep, worst thign can happen is your address which u are sending to is changed/spoofed.but you can still tripple check on device. if ur careful its less likely anything would hapen but in general just keep bitcoin in col wallet for long term. if u want to send and recieve or sell. its safe to keep up to 4, 5k on coinbase or kraken.  or even electrum mobile wallet

qd8orq submission Game Theory: Is this a Zero-Sum Game? 
hhl9n67 comment The adoption of sound money will drive productivity globally through improved opportunity cost calculations. This a positive sum game. Everyone wins, except for a few despots

See the belle epoch and gold 
hhkvpfp comment wealth is not a zero sum game. wealth is created by innovating, creating new things that never existed before. there is no end to the amount of wealth the earth can contain.  zero sum games are theoretical spaces, not real places. there is always something to be gained outside of the defined boundaries of the game.  communist and cultural marxist theory likes to talk in zero-sum terms. that's how their propaganda works.  and for plebs incapable of thinking creatively or acting creatively, it's easy to see why they fall for it. 
hhkxawf comment As long as you can get all your BTC wiped with no recourse…there will be no exponential trust or mass adoption IMHO 
hhlivc8 comment I guess it depends on what you define as the parameters of the game, and I wonder if the answer is worth anything at all except as a rather poorly constructed narrative. I could easily argue that using energy as the only standard, btc is a massive negative-sum game, since it consumes large amounts of energy and "does nothing". Finance-wise it is definitely eating into some investment assets, is that positive or negative? Wouldn't you need to investigate the nature of those assets to begin with? Are all zero-sum games inherently bad? Could it be a negative-sum game that makes other games less zero sum? Personally I don't see how any kind of last-word conclusion can be drawn even if you spent a year on it. 
hhlqnsa comment There will never be more than ₿21M, so the Bitcoin ledger itself is a zero-sum game. Every bitcoin a person owns is a bitcoin that other people cannot own.

However, the **value** of any good or currency is "in the eye of the beholder," so to speak. When two people come together to make a trade, it is entirely possible for both to walk away having made a profit in their own mind. Therefore, the global economy is **not** a zero-sum game. 
hhl0liv comment Your understanding of currency is flawed. Wealth is arbitrary and chaotic. Right now wealth is created by printing numbers on a screen. Even without crypto, you have people buying into stocks that are growing in valuations simply because inflation. P/E ratios are growing ever more arbitrary with companies that have 0 fundamentals. Wealth is created by taking advantage of the less educated. Not necessarily by innovation or new things. 
hhkwnrf comment Fair, but as more assets pour into BTC would this ultimately impact demand for the USD and therefore the purchasing power of the country from a macro level? (Would the substitution effect outpace the income effect?) 
hhm8e1h comment You are talking about changes in the monetary denomination of wealth (a change in how you account for the same things). Just because the M2 money supply is being expanded and more people are purchasing equities driving P/E rations higher, this doesn't mean at all that wealth is being created. It is just that the currency is being debased. I would argue that, instead, wealth is being destroyed or at least redistributed: because due to the uneven redistribution of the new money supply, the purchasing power of the majority is being reduced. 

Wealth is created when, keeping everything else constant, the E's of the P/E ratios increase, i.e. when value is being created. This only happens through innovation both in the things that are being done (new business or new business models), or in how the things are being done (new technologies that allow costs reduction)

This is why in free market economies with no political distortion, the nature of things is that prices lower with time: because through competition we learn to do things better and cheaper

Remember Economics 1.0: the long term supply of an economy is constant, and it doesn't care about the amount of money you use to account for it. This supply only shiftes through innovation 
hhluv2n comment You are wrong. Wealth can never be created by printing numbers on a screen. That is merely redistributing existing wealth, being done by those who have monopoly on money and abuse the priviledge. 

For wealth to be created, someone has to deferr consumption and dedicate to satisfying someone´s need/want through his actions. 
hhlby3q comment 
>as more assets pour into BTC would this ultimately impact demand for the USD

Mostly impact demand for gold, stocks, properties, IMHO. People who want to keep their wealth out of the dollar are already doing so.

If we look at the long term, the dollar is already losing it's buying power and this trend will continue, with or without Bitcoin being around.

hhkyk3u comment It's not that they don't believe in Bitcoin, it's just that they can't control it.

A central bank can control the issuing of their own money.

But they can't issue more Bitcoin. 
hhkyot2 comment Red pill 💊 incoming 
hhkyw6e comment Bitcoin shakes the foundations of the current system. Those who benefit from the current system have an aversion to Bitcoin because it threatens to end their gravy train. What did Herod do when he heard of a newborn king being born? He sought to kill the child before it could grow up and take over as ruler. Our current politicians and central bankers do not want to give up power and so will use the laws and regulations they themselves create to attempt to kill that which cannot be killed. Bitcoin is freedom. 
hhl1ter comment if you don't understand why govt hates freedom, then you don't understand govt at all.  

bitcoin takes (without asking) the power to create money and the power to control the monetary networks away from govt and gives it back to the people. bitcoin is a perfect instantiation of the basic human right of self ownership.  and govt hates competition.  

further, central banks print money to enrich their friends. and govt, being the institution who created central banks and who gives them all of their power, is the number one friend of central banks. central banks in fact are govt institutions no matter what they might say to the contrary.   so what we have is an infinite money tree for every tyrant, beaurocrat, politician, king, and regulator in the world to grow the power and size of government with no limit.  and for the last 100 years, that's exactly what we see. an unending and malignant growth of centralized govt power.  central banks are solely responsible for the size, length, and death counts of every war, especially in recent 20th and 21st century human history (you know, the biggest wars ever?).  it's a myth that tax dollars pay for government. 2/3 of their budget comes from money printing and debt that will never be paid.  bitcoin can fix this. bitcoin can end wars. that is if you want it.  

and as a nice side effect, bitcoin is also censorship resistant (censorship proof really), confiscation-resistant, borderless, and won't be devalued intentionally like your fiat currencies.  you still wonder why govt hates it? 
hhl2cr2 comment Believe in what sense? I'm sure they are quite aware of the fact how empowering bitcoin is for the individual. Which is exactly the reason why they don't like it. 
hhkzh8j comment So what you’re witnessing is a common tactic. “Do as I say, not as I do” is a common thing government does when they want control. Right now, oil and the majority of the world’s financial well-being is tied directly to the U.S.A GDP and to the U.S. Dollar. If bitcoin becomes too powerful due to its de-centralized nature, the whole world will eventually have another option to base their value off of, rather than the dollar. This is a huge threat to the U.S. since the whole world simply caters to the U.S. because if it falls, they all fall.

Now, the government simply wants to buy itself some time to buy up as much Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency to have a majority stake in it all and have some control over it. They scare their citizens into selling because there is only a limited amount of bitcoins. Every time the market dips, banks and government are buying and buying while others panic sell. 
Thus, we go back to “Do as I say, not as I do.” They will do anything possible to make it look like a pitfall is rearing, yet they are the one’s creating such pitfall. They warn of their upcoming intent, “taxing, making it illegal, shut it down, political theatre act…” anything that will make the market bearish and force people to sell, then they cancel all of their malicious lawsuits and legislature, and greatly benefit from the rising of it. 
Also, another quick note, when the FBI seized upon The Silk Road, they also took control of over $4,500,000,000 worth of bitcoin at today’s current price of $65,000. So they definitely have us by the balls already.

Might have missed something, let me know.

hhl24nm comment Almost 90% of all the bitcoins have been mined though, so not that early either. 
hhl7gvr comment Yes but then again the remainder will take the next 120 years to complete. Many small time investors still have time to get their hands on >10 million satoshis before the game has even begun (IMO the game starts when Bitcoin reaches Unit of Account status). Until then, we are still setting up the game. So still a few more years of "early", even though we are not quite as early as before.  The people who failed to get any BTC before the game started will realize just how big an opportunity they had, even in 2021. They will no longer be able to easily buy Bitcoin. They will have to earn it the hard way, by slowly stacking sats one at a time.

qd9ibl submission There are stablecoins consistent with the value of bitcoin, but are there or will there ever be stablecoins consistent with the value of satoshi? 
hhl1slp comment Wrong. The only stable coin for bitcoin is....bitcoin.  Get ready for a mind fuck....it can be divided more than 1,00000000...mSats says hello! 
hhl6jli comment If I understand your question correctly, you're asking if there are coins that hold parity to a single Satoshi for the purpose of further divisibility of the smallest unit? If that's what you mean, I don't think this would be necessary.

For starters, there are layer 2 scaling solutions like Lightning Network that can already easily transact units smaller than a Sat off-chain. If we ever hit a point in Bitcoin's growth that we'd need to transact values under a Sat, then the average user would probably not be using the core blockchain anymore for day-to-day small transactions anyways. Secondly, there's actually no hard set reason why BTC is only divisible down to a Sat, therefore when the time comes, that can be updated in the code given a majority consensus from nodes.

The BTC pegged coins that you've seen aren't meant to do this, they only function to wrap BTC to be used in other blockchains like ERC-20. In other words, you exchange BTC into a smart contract that gives you a compatible token for that blockchain equal in value to your BTC and these tokens can then be used in defi for buying shitcoins or to earn yield etc. 
hhl3r8y comment I think you mean to ask if there's any currency in the world that has parity with 1 sat.

If so, there's plenty of countries with those currencies. 

For example: Vietnam, South Korea, Colombia, etc.

Have a look here:

qdama4 submission Is there enough bitcoin in the world? 
hhl8ku7 comment As far as I know, there are about 10^14 dollars in circulation. On the other hand, there are 2.1x10^15 sats. So more than dollars, but less than there are cents.

But I guess they can be devided more on a second layer (LN) 
hhlfck6 comment it can be infinitely divided using a 2nd layer .. which would most likely be primarily used for every day transactions like buying a bottle of water. 
hhlqa3h comment Bitcoin can be divided into more decimal places than the current 8, if there is ever a need. 
hhm055o comment Lightning supports millisats. 
hhm0v2z comment Unrealistic??? Get outta here 
hhl87hd comment sats is pretty normal in lightning usage 
hhlawc2 comment Bitcoin is a label. A descriptor. There are no bitcoins. Bitcoin network only understand satoshis. 2.1 quadrillion is enough. 
hhqinuz comment If we define "enough" as what Satoshi intended, then IIRC we're doomed to always be (at least) 12.50000001 BTC short

In practice even more due to burn addresses etc. But the missing 12.50000001 do not even exist in the blockchain. 
hhl7w4h comment that's why it's divisible by 100,000,000, or 8 decimal places. 
hhl8puo comment If it became the most valuable asset in the world at say 12 Trillion, with there being 2100 Trillion Sats that means each Sat would be like half a penny 
qdapcz submission Argument towards people not understanding Bitcoin / Crypto 
hhlgtzh comment As a Bitcoin holder, I've got to disagree on it being a "terrible argument".

People don't need to be computer manufacturers to know the benefits of computers (and mobile technology) because it is immediately within their daily lives. These are blue-chip companies. Same with Tesla - people have a good conceptual what an electric vehicle is, along with the potential for growth in a more environmentally-oriented future generation.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin is still seen today by the masses as "Internet Money", for which they'd have no use for except to invest in for future value. People are still googling "what is Bitcoin", and they are not googling *"What is a computer?"*.

Generally, the public starts gaining confidence when they can make use of the technology. Older people weren't very keen on the internet.... until things like Skype came which basically made overseas call charges obsolete, and Facebook where familiy photos could be shared. Their interest in the web didn't come as a result of suddenly being tech-heads.

In El Salvador, Bitcoin has some utility in locals being able to transfer wealth to families overseas. It's this type of usage that then gets people thinking about Bitcoin's increase in adoption. 
hhlnrp6 comment You are mixing up the asset and whatever it stands for.

They buy Microsoft/Apple/Tesla stocks because they understand stocks themselves. They understand that they represent a business's value and that these stocks will rise if that business does well and vice versa. And they understand just enough about computers and cars to know why people want more of them.

They don't buy BTC because they don't understand BTC. They don't understand what it represents and what makes it rise and fall. Because unlike Stocks, it doesn't represent some real world entity, it represents itself. And that's confusing them. 
hhl8dtg comment I think you should only invest in things you understand.

And you should understand how bitcoin works, and keep yours in cold storage. 
hhlf5m2 comment ignorance is willful. you can't save people who don't want to be saved.  bitcoin information is everywhere and easily accessible for those willing. we don't need amateur bitcoin evangelists annoying their friends and neighbors. that is counterproductive. 
hhmbvk3 comment You barely need to understand Bitcoin to invest in it. 

People don't quite understand what FIAT money is, what it represents, how & why it is constantly de-valuating and how this affects their lives. If they did, they would understand enough of Bitcoin to know what it can do for their lives, in the long term. Then they would heavily invest in it. 

The masses are both ignorant and naive. Those who control the world have made sure of it. 
hhok2zn comment I agree with your sentiment but not your reasoning. As others pointed out - people understand how stocks work, but they don't understand how Bitcoin works. They couldn't tell you the difference between Bitcoin and any other coin. It's even common to hear people use the word "Bitcoin" as a synonym to "cryptocurrency".

But the reason I think its a shit argument is because it's based purely on ignorance. It is the best performing asset of all time. How can someone not take a few hours of their time to figure out WHY?

It's completely moronic, and they will bathe in regret from sticking their heads in the sand. I guess it just proves how early we still are. 
hhozk6m comment The people who dont understand btc should really be more like 98%. 
hhl9e4g comment There has been a decade of anti-bitcoin propaganda and it’s infected the psyche of many people. The thing is, those who are intellectually curious and willing to expend time and energy have investigated bitcoin on their own. 

In a loose sense, those who deserve to benefit from bitcoin have and will into the future. Those who haven’t expended their time and energy into understanding the subject will not benefit from the network and technology. It’s good if you ask me.

Going forward, I personally think that the visionaries (Jack Dorsey, Jack Mallers, Ross Stevens, Alyse Killeen, etc) who have a deep understanding of the tech will build innovative solutions that regular propagandized folk will end up using. They won’t buy in per se, they’ll just be the end user/product. 
hhlhw3c comment Good argument, I thought of that as well, but then you could also just say that Bitcoin is nothing more than a cheap way to send money anywhere in the world, yet that still doesn’t seem like it’s enough to get people to invest or use it.

But I guess people also stick to what they know and transitioning from your normal payment methods to something completely new, isn’t as simple as switching toothpaste brands. 
hhluxqb comment Also a good point!

hhlcyz2 comment The real question here should be “F2P or P2P”? 
hhl9b7d comment I might be down voted for this and please I mean no offense but if you had kept those coins and had become a multi millionaire before you are 25 you would of probably become an insufferable ass.
Now is the time to stack your sats  and work hard, make friends just get a effing life so that when you are in your 30s you will appreciate your life regardless of your wealth. note if you hodl you will probably be wealthy 
Good luck

So one month you get more BTC than an other month.

hhm7fko comment Most people need USD because they actually need to buy shit with their paychecks, but good video 
hhly6ia comment I use cryptocurrency, but there's no reason to be naïve or fanatical about it.

History has shown time and time again that governments can interfere and that small groups of business people can wrest control of ANYTHING by way of mergers and acquisitions.

Please do not go around thinking that a distributed ledger is anywhere near the protection from centralized control that people say it is.  That is way beyond wishful thinking.

I can't say it enough.  A high percentage of endeavors start out with gloriously noble mission statements.  La-la-la-laaaaaaaaaaa!  Then one by one get bought up with offers they can't refuse.  Why?  Because that is the nature of humanity.

Use cryptocurrency as a TOOL and put aside any HOLY GRAILISM.

hhlfhaa comment ELI15?

Is this bearish or bullish? 
hhlakym comment tldr; The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF is on track to reach a limit on the number of futures contracts it's allowed after quickly becoming a little too popular. After just a couple of days of trading, the fund has reached 1,900 contracts sold for October and there is a 2,000 front-month limit imposed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. There are already 1,400 contracts for November.

*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.* 
hhlanuh comment and here is just one example of how this bogus derivative really has little to do with bitcoin at all. you'd be nuts to invest. and this will especially be the case when the spot etf comes out. 
hhltse5 comment Futures roll is gonna be a MF for these PM’s 
hhlirx1 comment so another obstacles? why just not buying BTC directly? 
hhntbn0 comment as I thought
and in the future, the price will deviate even more
therefore buy btc on Binance, Huobi, Kraken, Coinbase, Bitfinex, and anywhere, and not via ETF. 
hhosa3i comment I can’t help that I’m so popular. 

The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF is on track to reach a limit on the number of futures contracts it’s allowed, which could result in longer contracts that may stray from BTC prices.

hhla6ni comment Ok. Im a newb and ignorant w all this so go easy and keep it eli5. Trying to wd money from online casino (under 500). I submitted a free bitcoin wallet to casino that cashapp offers which from what I understand would change address after each use. Casino got back to me asking if this is a static wallet (which I'm guessing it isnt) so my question if I'm only withdrawing once and never again does it really matter if static or not? OR should I just play it safe and get one and if thats the case is coinage a good place to get a static wallet that ill be easily able to convert to cash for a dummy like me? Any help appreciated please keep it simple and yes I'm broke and need money not an investment in bitcoin rn so keep that in mind thank you for any help! 
hhla8lv comment *coinbase not coinage sorry 
hhlaezg comment your language is weird. what do you mean "submitted a free bitcoin wallet to casino"? you mean you sent them bitcoin? or you sent them a wallet address?   

also "static wallet" isn't a thing. i don't know what they are saying.  

elaborate please. 
hhnwuh9 comment Wallets store keys. They don't convert anything. Get your btc out to a good wallet first. Then you can research how to sell it. Don't google for wallets, go to www.bitcoin.org and see recommendations there. 
hhlam98 comment Sent them a wallet address i want my cash sent to. I did this because it seemed simpler then having to get bank wiring instructions for the kyc process and they said deposit would be quicker. Static wallet it the casinos terminology, they asked if it was static (and wouldn't be changing) so I just assumed that was bitcoin terminology, sorry about that but again I don't know shit about any of this hence why I'm asking you guys. 
hhlaxsm comment oh i see. if you gave them a receiving address from coinbase, or a 3rd party service like that, then the receiving address is not static in the sense that it's based on a temporary invoice sort of thing.  but it matters little. either way you will eventually get the funds. the worst that could happen is they send it and it doesn't show up in your coinbase account, and you have to contact coinbase support and explain why there was such a delay.      

the best practice is to use your own non custodial open source wallet to receive funds. those are always "static" to use their weird terminology. i don't know how temporal the coinbase receiving addresses are, but it doesn't really matter that critically. they are trying to avoid your future complaint saying "i didn't get the funds" because you used a temporary address. it doesn't mean the funds go nowhere. it just means the funds go into their general accounting abyss, and they (coinbase in this example) need to do manual adjustments to get it to land into your account.  maybe or maybe not. i don't know how coinbase receiving addresses work.    

**so short answer**: get your own open source non custodial wallet. electrum works, and is widely used and tested.  then if you want to sell for cash later, send it to coinbase. but imo you'd be dumb to sell now, or in the next few months or even years.

hhp5epl comment I wish it was just enter cash and an address. This is a voucher once you do KYC which idk how to feel about. On the surface yes BTC is "more accessible" but how many people would use it? This might just give Bitcoin a bad name and an aura of "way too complex" when people could use a simple debit card.

I'm sure some people would prefer this to exchanges but I borderline think this is to tarnish BTC reputation.

Edit.

I wrote and asked about my withdrawal limit and I have so far received two responses:

1. Sorry we are not going to increase your purchase limit

2. Our decision is final.

I shouldn’t be flabbergasted but I am. I’m a very VERY good customer but they haven’t ever read my question correctly and furthermore doubled down on their ignorance.

hhle6th comment Why would you need more than 50k/day? 10 days for 500k isn’t much to wait. Just my opinion I guess you can send them a message if you want to increase this limitation.

qdbri7 submission I think bitcoin has entered an eternal bull market 
qdbs3i submission Why I find BTC profit taking more difficult than any other asset 
hhlfm7d comment bitcoin teaches you to think longer term and to consider opportunity cost. 

Everything you take out of your bitcoin stash has to be weighed against the incredible performance BTC will have in future. The bitcoin network is completely sound, and the asset it produces is the hardest in the world. Hence, unlike many other crypto projects, it is certain that BTC is highly robust.

So if you want to treat yourself to a PS5, you can sell $500 worth of BTC, or just spend $500 of fiat. But that same amount $500 would be worth $5000 in about 5 years if held in BTC. Who would buy a PS5 for $5000? It discourages superfluous spending. 
hhledyn comment you're only taking profit from yourself.  the only reasons you should take profit in bitcoin are if you either need the cash for bills, or you have a trading edge on the market (you probably don't).  dollars are terrible to hold for long, for obvious reasons, i hope. 
hhljciq comment If billionaires buy it all up, prices will shoot up and less wealthy people will take profits, freeing up more bitcoin to buy. 
hhltf7x comment Do you believe the dollar will die by inflation (hyper inflation?)  If so then it's worthwhile to look at the Weimar hyperinflationary event....the mark went parabolic, stock valuations also went parabolic but alot of companies died because they were not fundamentally good companies. So if you converted your marks to ownership of good companies you maintained your purchasing power AND your company was poised to do well following the crack up......on the other hand another succesful strategy was to see the problem and convert all your German marks to gold backed Swiss francs...BTC is the Swiss franc of today 
hhpb4sa comment Investing isn’t about making $, it’s about managing risk to maximize value out of finite resources. 
hhlfv82 comment BTC is for profit as investing in fiat is for profit. You are investing in a future for society, not a future for your ugly ass wife 
hhlfh1x comment Thank you. Well I haven't sold BTC for a long time, except in my former trading portfolio (but crypto trading is now banned in UK), so for most of the year I've just been increasing my alts portfolio.

But if Bitcoin goes parabolic out of nowhere, like snapping to over 100k by the end of the weekend, I'm very likely to be taking some profit. The intention isn't to hold fiat as I already have an emergency fund, and so my usage of profit will be towards a very intentional purpose. The profit-taking would also be only a small proportion of my BTC portfolio.

Hope that makes sense. This is just my way of risk-management, and increasing my BTC amount should a pullback occur. The only objective to my risk management would be the points made in the original post.
