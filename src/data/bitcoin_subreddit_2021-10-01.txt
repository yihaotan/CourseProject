pywcaf submission Chivo Wallet users in El Salvador will be saving .20 cents when paying in Bitcoin. 
hex6nry comment Does this 20 cent discount work because the proprietor will end up saving more than the discount rate by skipping payment intermediaries? Or is a subsidy being offered to promote Chivo? Maybe a combination of both. 
hexe0yx comment Great first step to widespread adoption 
hexstkw comment Gallons? I thought El Salvador used the metric system. 
hey4gih comment It's too bad that it's only valid until October 14 
hf05mjo comment Gas goes for about 3.80/g and diesel for about 3.20/g, so this would mean a nice 6% discount 
hez26a2 comment Credit card fees are generally more than 20 cents per transaction, so I don't see why this would have to be subsidized. The businesses would make more money if they get a lightning payment even if they discount 20 cents off of every order. 
hf1s1m6 comment Is this 0.20 cents or 0.20 dollars? 0.20 dollars is a good deal 
heyxn25 comment They do, but some countries use different units for certain commodities or consumables for largely historical reasons (always been priced / traded in that unit) 
heykjrn comment Well I think they wanna test how people will react to it, I am sure if lot of people show interest they will offer discounts with Chivo on other things too.

hexofrl comment Do some research 
hexf9z4 comment I'm not a financial advisor but I get 401k, insurance, and child support taken out of my cheek. After taxes I might get 300 a week check, more like 260-280/week after everything's taken out of my check... But I live very minimalistic and DCA into crypto along with 401k.  I'm not part of the FIRE movement, no disrespect, but I just try to make it to where I can have a decent retirement. Nothing fancy. Wanna have more kids. I know how to feed the fam. Just need a bigger fam...  All family is not blood. I got closer family that ain't blood related.. I'll always look out for my family. I do like some of the FIRE movements things but I believe in crypto.  High risk, high reward. Leverage trading. I'm a fairly decent leverage trader, not to toot my horn but I know patterns and can make money. I just do it on the side of my regular job which I get my insurance benefits, etc. 


Back to OPs question. I bought BTC 2 days ago and have since received 5% profit in 2 days.  Like holy hell on good and know I need to get some together to leverage trade... Seriously I'm not a financial advisor but I do this shit... Wish I would've leverage trade the other day but I can't afford to lose. If I had some financial backing I would blow up. I can make money legally. Need money to make money. I'm about to sacrifice a few months and then come out strong. I know how to make money legally and will continue to work my job, but I'm not working past 50 unless I want to.  I am intelligent enough to be financially successfully these next 15 years and just play the market PT and make tiny moves to secure my retirement and debts paid with plenty to retire at the age of 50-55 easily (and I came from poverty) but I will probably stay active until my 80s making money. I just need a woman on the same page.  We could have nice things but we're not keeping up with the Kardashians.

heyfknf comment Satoshi having 1 million BTC is a myth created by sergio which was quickly shown to be flawed and contradictory.
Here is Sergio's original post - 

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=175996.msg1832533#msg1832533

and followup

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=178629.0

Where Greg and others point out flaws in his research and how some of it is self contradictory 

Here is Bitmex's follow up research on the matter - 

https://blog.bitmex.com/satoshis-1-million-bitcoin/

>In conclusion, although there is strong evidence of a dominant miner in 2009, we think **the evidence is far less robust than many have assumed.** Although a picture is worth a thousand words, sometimes pictures can be a little misleading. Even if one is convinced, the evidence only supports the claim that the **dominant miner may have generated significantly less than a million bitcoin in our view. Perhaps 600,000 to 700,000 bitcoin** is a better estimate.

>**None of the above says much about whether the dominant miner was Satoshi**, although we know Satoshi mined block 9, which we have allocated to the dominant miner in our analysis. **However this is in a slope of just 11 blocks, so it‚Äôs certainly not conclusive**. Whoever the dominant miner was, it is of course **possible the keys have been lost or discarded by now**.

Thus block 9 and genesis block was created by Satoshi 100%, and the evidence reflects he might have mined 11 blocks at least in addition to the genesis under these assumptions .

This means the evidence suggests we definitely know satoshi mined 2 blocks , and likely mined 11 blocks, and that **perhaps** there was a dominant miner who mined between 600-700k bitcoin(not blocks). **There are other explanations for the extranonce pattern that do not point to a dominant miner. Simply a similar software setup can cause this.**

Since there was over 3 days between the genesis block being mined and block 1 and difficulty was 1 it would be safer to assume satoshi waited for other miners to start mining before joining in .

hexxp85 comment Believe it or not there was a website some dude was maintaining (his name alludes me at this moment) but he had one of the first ‚Äòfaucets‚Äô where anyone with a bitcoin address can get 50 free bitcoins ! Can you imagine how some of the early adopters would‚Äôve simply change addresses and spam that faucet until you had hundreds, if not thousands of bitcoin without any effort??

For modern perspective, as of October 1st 2021, 50 bitcoins would equal approximately 2.1 million dollars today!! UGH WTF was I doing back in late 2009-early 2010?!? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
hfbxgho comment I just read the entire thread of the history of BitDNS and came to the realization that my friend was not Satoshi Nakamoto, he was Bytemaster. He made his post on May 17, 2011, not inventing Bitcoin but coming up with the solution to what lead to the modern day alt-coins. This solution was something these engineers had been struggling with from November 18, 2010 through the end of the thread on May 17, 2011. 

In early 2011 the startup I worked at encouraged us to study blockchain & keep up with what was happening online. They taught us classes during work. One of my coworkers made it from the customer service floor to the IT floor. The door was wide open for all of us but I guess we were walking around with our eyes closed. 

Appamatto, Netsukuku, Pete Sunde, Hal Finney, Ribbuck, , R Horning, Carl Auerbach, Kiba, Chaord, Ben Coder, Theymos, Nanotube, Anonymous, jgarzik, em3rgent0rdr, Satoshi, smoketoomuch, joe, bencoder Bytemaster & others made it possible.  Apologies to Satoshi.

hexxvkn comment Gavin Andresen and it wasn't 50, it was only 5 at the beginning. 
hey0fwl comment The reason I‚Äôm trying to figure it out is on December 20, 2010 I was hired by a startup in San Francisco. We were using Blockchain tech. The leadership team taught us how blockchain technology worked. Prior to working there I worked at a previous startup for the chairman of the board. He taught me about investing but I couldn‚Äôt invest in startups due to regulations. Anyhow, Fast forward to Mid 2011 I was having a conversation with one of my colleagues at my new company, he had a side project. I wanted to buy bitcoin but I didn‚Äôt want to hold the keys because I didn‚Äôt fully understand how self custody worked and I wanted him to hold the keys for me or put the money in the bank. He tried to explain self custody to me but I didn‚Äôt get it (the keys). I then asked him if I could invest in his project & he said no. I asked why not, you could do it just like Bitcoin. He looked over at one of his team members and said we could tokenize the project and essentially sell shares.  He then told his teammate to go get me some Bitcoins, which he did on a thumb drive. He said, there‚Äôs going to be a party in 10 years and that‚Äôs your key. I asked him where‚Äôs the party and he replied, the moon. I said no really where?  He said the moon. I looked at him funny and went my merry way, not understanding what just happened. 

On the way home, my buddy, who got me the job there told me to hold on to it and not lose it. I of course can‚Äôt find it. I paid $500 for those Bitcoin. 

I‚Äôm trying to figure out if there where already other projects tokenized between December 20, 2010 & May 2011.  There‚Äôs more to it but that‚Äôs it in a nutshell.

heyn6ke comment To feel the rush of endorphins while watching the price skyrocket up 3K is why I compulsively check the price every minute like a true addict 
hf0tc56 comment I love days like this where bitcoin does what bitcoin has always done. It shuts down all the loser internet guess-boys and makes them suck sweaty foot. It quiets the news-cycle ‚Äúthis is why the price did *x*‚Äù corn balls too.

Price action is the emergent outcome of millions of global actors. The reliability, utility and fundamentals of the network are what‚Äôs important. Real-world use cases and the development of Bitcoin‚Äôs layered payment stack will continue to push this movement to the forefront of global finance and commerce. It will disrupt closed system after closed system on its ascension to global dominance. 

Price guesses are the lowest form of bitcoin content. It‚Äôs what the vapid and uninformed minds seem to focus on. I absolutely love when reality shits on all of the guess-boys - you kids are lames. Bitcoin‚Äôs purchasing power will catch up to the immense value of the network over the next decade. To the patient and informed will go the spoils. Cheers to all the real bitcoiner‚Äôs out there‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre not selling!

hey6h7o comment Congrats and welcome. Now you‚Äôre invested you‚Äôll take more interest in articles and learn as you go along. How many Sats did $20 get you?

This group will mostly recommend getting a hardware wallet and transferring your BTC to that and holding it for an indeterminate amount of time.

However, you can just keep it in CashApp and continue to DCA (top up every week or so) and watch your investment grow. 
hey9zgp comment If you are interested in Bitcoin as an investment, dollar-cost-average your money into it. You can keep the Bitcoins/satoshis in the cashapp until you think you‚Äôve invested an considerable amount, it‚Äôs then where you should transfer it into a more secure wallet: hardware or cold wallet.

If you want to use your Bitcoins, just find a store which accepts Bitcoin and spend it.

heydp02 comment SEC thinks crypto is cool :] 
heylhqw comment Of course the government would never lie to us. 
heymr2a comment >Effectively the chairman said that the Fed‚Äôs hands are tied when it comes to inflation

Agreed.

The Fed cannot substantially increase the interest rate to fight inflation because that would bankrupt half of the US economy. However, he can also not maintain a low interest rate while just letting inflation rage and take its toll. In the end, that would also bankrupt half of the US economy.

The existence of shortages means that the price is not allowed to go up in order to restore equilibrium in the market. The damage caused by a shortage is usually even worse than by inflation. Just ask Venezuela. They ended up with both shortages and inflation.

What Powell means, concerning "his hands being tied", is that if inflation does not magically come down by itself -- why would it? -- and if shortages do not mysteriously disappear by themselves -- they obviously won't -- then he will not be able to do anything about these things.

In fact, we already knew that.

The real information is therefore that Powell turns out to be not entirely delusional. So, even if Biden may possibly be malfunctioning in terms of some of his mental capacities, Powell is still doing fine. We can ask questions to Powell. He calmly answers them. His answers are even of good quality.

pz37ru submission How would Bitcoin react if FED raises the interest rate this month or in the coming weeks? 
heybzhr comment When interest rates go up the price of the US dollar goes up with gold going down.
I'm not sure if Bitcoin is inversely related as well but I would bet btc would drop a bit at least for a little while.

BTC is new and has exciting possibilities for the future.
So BTC perhaps will continue to go up  year over year regardless of the fed policy.  An outright ban of bitcoin by the eu and USA or some other unknown super duper tech surpasses btc are a couple of things I could see happening but are very unlikely too.

If so, this would be quite interesting also to support the network. 
heygdjn comment Not any more, but I did when I was investing in it. The whole point of blockchain tech is that users should be able to do this to verify their own transactions and not need to trust third parties. If you just trust another block explorer then what is the meaning of 'trustlessness', and if you value decentralization the why wouldn't you want to contribute to the network? 
heyo39m comment So thank you all for your explanations. In general I just want to get to know some more technical details about how all this blockchain technology works, which might be some good starting point to learn about and contribute.

Regarding transactions and security?
Is this also working if I hold my coins on some exchange or do I need a hardware wallet?

Think if I make some profits till next year I can spend some pieces on new stuff.

hez46px comment This x 1000.

The critique that capitalism causes consumerism and over-consumption is always made by people who don't understand time preference. Capitalism, when the money is debt-based central bank monopoly money driven by artificially low interest rates, encourages consumerism and over-consumption. Capitalism with hard money and real interest rates encourages savings and long-term investment.
