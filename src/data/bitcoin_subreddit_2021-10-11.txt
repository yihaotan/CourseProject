q5kd76 submission I just got my student visa approved with the majority of my wealth allocated on bitcoin (~60%). 
hg733mn comment As a Spaniard, this is completely misleading info

Spain is NOT a crypto heaven. You get taxed anywhere from 20 to 25% on capital gains

And we are not adopting bitcoin anytime soon. We are on Euro, we have almost no saying on monetary matters

Sounds like you might be placing Spain on South America... 
hg6a8gi comment Most countries tax it as an asset for capital gains, so I don't see why they wouldn't consider it an asset. 
hg9ck4z comment Now, many countries consider bitcoin as an hard asset.so it should not be problem. 
hg80bfo comment Well maybe I misled a little bit I am so happy for my visa LoL

But you fellow spaniards have it easier than us in Latin America. Mexico City has 8 million inhabitants and 2 Bitcoin ATMs (one of them does not have cash 50% of the time) 
hg6g2oh comment The lady that took my papers explicitly told me that I needed to send more proof of funds so I was really worried but stick and sent them my trezor screenshots (w/o any public or private key just the balance). But yeah at a higher review level Bitcoin is a hard asset 
hg7zwli comment Can you post your trezor screenshots so we can all provide proof of funds?

We're still really early, so I'm not surprised that this was accepted instead of a message signed with your public key. I'm just pleasantly surprised that "proof" of bitcoin ownership was accepted at all as proof of funds.

Completely unrelated, what are you going to study in Spain?

q5kk6f submission new to bitcoin and have a couple questions 
hg685kz comment There's no way of knowing when the best time to invest in but if you plan on holding for years then it doesn't matter. We will look back at the price right now as people now look back at the price 1 year ago. 
hg69by2 comment Buy and hold Bitcoins, just Bitcoins, long term and with a strong hand. Never sell Bitcoins in any attempt to time the market. Never invest money you might need w/in the next five or ten years. Maintain an emergency cash cushion, and consider holding an emergency credit card with no annual fee, zero balance, and a high limit so that you won't ever be forced to sell any of your Bitcoins.

Remember: TA is pure bullshit. Day trading is for fools. Fools and their money are soon parted.

The above strategy has enjoyed a long term average ROI of about 135% per year. 
hg686o1 comment When you convert money to Bitcoin, the exchange is taking a fee. This probably explains why your 100 turned into 96. Without knowing where you‚Äôre buying Bitcoin it is hard to be sure.

However, 4% fees are super high. Look for a less expensive way to convert money into Bitcoin. 
hg68w90 comment Don't try to time the market. Buy it when you can. Don't sell until you *have* to. Think long term.

>I seem to lose money pretty much every time sadly

>Like take the other day I had about ¬£3 on there already added ¬£100 yet I somehow ended up with about ¬£96 odd that's ¬£7 down basically 

Depending on how you are buying it, fees may be a big part of the answer.

My local Bitcoin ATM for example seems to be very reasonable, you can "buy bitcoin for only a $0.99 fee!" But in order to understand what you are really paying you need to look at the price per BTC quoted on the ATM vs real world prices.

As I type this, BTC ~$54,924 (USD) -- if I go to that ATM, it is probably quoting a price like $57,000. So you "only" pay a $0.99 fee to overpay for BTC.

Using those numbers above, for $100 at that ATM you'd get 0.0017194736842105 BTC. At the real exchange rate of $54,924 that's only $94.44. 
hg6b9lf comment > when should I be spending

Time in the market beats timing the market. 
hg6d2qq comment Just hold it. Don‚Äôt worry about big drops its part of the volatility of crypto. Just buy more as it dips to drop your average cost down and have a strategy for realising profits. 
hg6h4bv comment These are not really bitcoin specific questions but questions about trading and investing in general.

I'm going to take a different approach than the other people that replied to you and suggest that you first take some time to learn how the traditional markets work and how to invest responsibly in general. Learn about things like risk management and dollar cost averaging.

Short answer is that nobody knows when to buy or sell Bitcoin, or any asset in general. 
hg8aaqx comment Just buy and hold. It's actually very easy. Don't overcomplicate it. 
hgd6j2u comment It sounds as though you really need to do some more research to understand when is best to buy for you. Read up as much as you can about Bitcoin, what it is, how it works, what's happening in the industry etc as this will help to inform you - it's a very personal decision and not something others can advise on as it's your money being spent at the end of the day. 

Keep learning, watching YT videos, reading up etc and buy when you feel comfortable in your understanding. Hope this helps :)

q5l12g submission Holding BTC and not selling the top.. 
hg6z72f comment I've been holding since 2013. I've held through every meteoric rise and every subsequent drop. It may not be the most profitable strategy, but it is certainly the safest. 

Let's be real: if you can reliably get 200% per year just by holding, why greed for more? 
hg6euh9 comment I bought in 2017, sold a little to get into some alt coins, but have held up to $19k and down to $3.8k.  I bought more in 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021.  There is no guarantee that there is a blow off top again this time, things look different and the timescale for the bull run is longer.  It could just keep clumsily walking up and not take an 80% drop after a hyperbolic rise.

All that said, there is a portion of my portfolio that I would sell if we get to $125k+ by December.  I leveraged into a position that I‚Äôd like to clear, but that‚Äôs a psychological decision. 
hg6ms7m comment makes sense? nobody knows where the top is until it's long over. 
hg6vlu6 comment There aren those who say its important to take some profits off the table (but never the whole stack) and there are those hard core hodlers that never sell their btc.  Because when the world is ready,  you wont have to.  You can just spend it.

Disclaimer.  This is not, and nor should you take financial advice from a guy that has coke & twizzlers for breakfast.  Know your goals and you do you 
hg75b1a comment I bought in 2011. Bought when BTC was at $200 and sold at 1K thought I hit the moon and 10k was a dream that it would never happen. 

Got back in a few years later and had some accounts that I forgot about. That were a good jumpstart that didn‚Äôt make me feel completely out of it. 

As of now. IM NEVER FUCKING SELLING!

Edit: clarification 
hg6ewid comment Keep calm and stack sats 
hg80nh0 comment Here's a straight fact for you - Nobody who has held Bitcoin for at least four years has ever lost money. Not one single person, and that's been true since Bitcoin was 4 years old.

Just HODL and be happy. 
hg6c72g comment Selling at the top would be great, just don‚Äôt ever when that is and anyone who says they do..liar 
hg72gj0 comment I feel like i have a good bag of btc for early retirement in 10 years. I actually plan to swing trade a small amount of btc on major dips in the future. If Im wrong on the dip, well I dont care because I love btc and I'll keep stacking downwards. If the dip reverses with a 25% gain then I sell for short-term profit and enjoy the small things in life.

Of course not.

> Is this an exchange?

Quite possible. 
hg7g8u5 comment You can deposit and withdraw "the same Bitcoin", but multiple times. 
hg7g48w comment This is an Exchange üí± 
hg940t1 comment Rather concerned that none of the previous replies can identify the owner of the address at one glance. It's binance. 
hg9re90 comment That's not a wallet, that's an address.

Something automated is using it to send/receive a lot. Most likely an exchange owned address. 
hgacm0f comment To know what fraction of all bitcoins in existence have passed through that address, you'd have to run taint analysis on the entire UTxO set. It's a big computing job, but it's possible. 
hg7i42f comment The fact that you can transact multiple times bitcoin makes it really possible instead.
It doesn‚Äôt mean the same owning 80% of bitcoin and exchanging 80% of the quantity of total bitcoin in circulation, is a really different thing.
That‚Äôs not scary at all. 
hg9rij7 comment Don't be so concerned. Most people just don't care.

hg6ecqy comment The bitcoin (dot) com domain is owned by a convicted felon who describes himself as "Bitcoin Jesus" and has a long history of unscrupulous behavior. From [vouching for MtGox solvency before it collapsed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/77vrek/roger_ver_on_mtgox_bitcoin_exchange_for_the/), to promoting Craig Wright [as if he were Satoshi Nakamoto](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/776fim/funny_how_all_the_criminals_and_fraudsters_in/), the owner acquired the "r / btc" subreddit and packed its mod team with paid employees to spread divisive misinformation about the bitcoin protocol and various individuals in the bitcoin space, including this subreddit as a whole.

hg6t2ly comment Bech32 is cheaper than P2SH, but I don't think it's worth moving your coins from P2SH to bech32 solely for the cheaper transaction fee. It's because you'll pay one more transaction fee.

hg6ku1t comment Reframe the question in terms of Bitcoin, and the answer presents itself: ‚Äúif person A buys .02 Bitcoin a few years ago, and person B buys .02 Bitcoin today‚Ä¶‚Äù >> have the same amount of coin, just at a different cost basis.  Beyond that, depending on where you live, person A may be subject to a lower capital gains tax rate.

hg6jzj1 comment >I am asking this simply because I don't know when I sell my bitcoins for altcoins

Never. 
hg766rx comment Current price: $1000. Assuming person A bought 1 btc for $100 and person B bought 1 for $1000.

Person A profits $900. Note: If they bought 2 for $100, the profit doubles.

Person B profits $0.


This should not be a deciding factor on whether or not to sell btc for alt coins. 
hg8n4dh comment If you had bought bitcoin when it was 100$ and it went up to 2000 (100 * 20 = 2000) it would be a bigger gain than 1000 to 2000 (1000 * 2 = 2000). In this example when you buy at 100$ bitcoin it‚Äôs a 2000% percent change or 20X to get to 2000. When it‚Äôs 1000 to get to 2000 Is only 100% so much less of profit that the person who got in lower. 

Let‚Äôs say you bought 100 bitcoin at 5 dollars each. Right now because bitcoin is around 53,000 your 100 btc or 500$ investment would be around 5 million dollars. 
If you had bought the 100 btc at 25,000
Then your 500 dollar investment will double at 50,000ish leaving your with 1000, much much less than the people at the bottom

hg6lwkk comment we certainly don't need a shitcoin to do what defi is trying to do, assuming they ever do anything worthwhile. sorry but nfts and hacked smart contracts aren't convincing me yet.  everything they are doing will eventually be done better on bitcoin because the underlying token is more censorship resistant and secure. 
hg7fuh3 comment if you are a lender, why would you want your Smart contract's escrow measured in chuckie cheese tokens?

Bitcoin is the soundest money, and therefore the perfect escrow for decentralized finance. Defi will not be built on shitcoins long term.

hg72lua comment Don't forget major corporations and sovereign nations will also be buying bitcoin. So bitcoin per person will be even smaller than that. 
hg6pfu8 comment You are spot-on, Diesel!  Bitcoin has a standard for determining its value. It is 1/21-millionth of the economy that it enables. It also has a way to enforce this measurement; the honest, uncorruptable economy that it controls.

The USD on the other hand has no standard of measurement. It doesn't even have a legal definition! But who cares? For now it has the cred, and nine out of ten here would love to have their BTC rise in value so that they could sell it for USD and "make money".

But like you say, they're missing the whole point. 
hg7lk32 comment Also: bitcoin is capacity on a global network, not a fiat proxy. People are underestimating two things 1) the value of having capacity on that network, and 2) what will be exchanged for capacity on that network. Michael Saylor is almost there when he explains stuff but he uses the energy storage/dematerialisation analogy, which is a little indirect.

In the future, exchanging 1btc will mean moving 1/21M of capacity from one actor to another, rather than 1/21M of equivalent purchasing power (fiat, gold, whatever you want to convert around). That capacity will be used as the base for layer-2 solutions (like lightning right now, but more extended: trustless data storage, encrypted computation between untrusted parties, etc). This will allow a true information economy to be established, and bitcoin will denominate the value of information.

When bitcoin allows the expression of this "information value" it will be a really exciting moment. Absolutely nobody will exchange bitcoin for commodity items like rocks or paper. It will only be exchanged for energy or information. 
hg6o190 comment While I see where you‚Äôre coming from, it‚Äôs still going to have a conversion. Just like how 7,00,000 rupees makes no realistic sense to an American how much that is so they convert it to USD. 
hg7fhqr comment Also factor in the amount of lost BTC. Estimates are that we may only have 16m BTC when mining finishes. 
hg7422r comment When people are saying BTC to $1M they are comparing the purchasing power of $1M now. In an economy where 1 BTC  = $1M you won't want $1M

q5na4v submission How bitcoin circulated or distributed ? 
hg7g3i9 comment Very simply:

1. In the beginning, there were no transactions in the mempool, because of course you need a source and destination address for a *regular* transaction, and no source had BTC.
2. A block with 0 transactions can still be mined, however, and so a block was mined.
3. Every mined block has an included special "coinbase" transaction which has no originating address (technically I think it's more the vin index is -1 or something) but specifies a destination address.  The 1st of these, in block 0, was 50BTC.  (The 2nd in block 1 also was 50BTC.  In fact there's 210,000 of these before a "halvening", after which it is cut in 2.  25, 12.5, 6.25 (today) etc.)
4. That address now had 50BTC which was "mined" colloquially, i.e. it came from a coinbase transaction.

Repeat this for many blocks in the beginning, and as more miners join, the addresses with these coinbase transactions start to diversify.  Once those addresses start using BTC, it propagates further into the ecosystem.  They can now spend those BTC in real transactions between themselves (source address) and someone else.

Note that those first blocks were mined by Satoshi, and for the most part almost none of the early rewards are spent, presumably as they are his.  You can examine the chain to see when non-Satoshi miners appear to jump in. 
hg6sesr comment Mining is a sport to see which computer can solve a puzzle the fastest. The faster your computer is, the more likely you are to win. Whoever wins, wins a **block** as a reward. A block was originally worth 50 BTC in 2009, but approximately every four years that reward has been cut in half. So in 2012 the reward was slashed to 25 BTC, in 2016 the reward was slashed to 12.5 BTC, and in 2020 the reward was slashed to 6.25 BTC per block.

Any questions? 
hg6sf3s comment open to anyone. that's how. where have you been? 
hg6siow comment Whoever mines, has a chance to win, since it was only mined by satoshi at the start, the first few blocks went to him, pretty simple. 
hg6zrun comment Miners can mine empty blocks, so mining works even when there are no transactions. 
hg75utv comment Miners are rewarded with newly created currency.

From there, selling coins for people to buy, or giving them to others; however distribution gets started.

Initially, it all came from mining. They are rewarded for adding to the blockchain. 
hg7m6ny comment > But at the early stage nobody has bitcoin

At the early stage, thousands of people had one or two 50BTC coins from mining on a laptop or desktop, and nothing to spend it on, nobody to sell it to  

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=24.0 
hg6xfm1 comment In layman languange, mining is just verification and recording of transaction from one user to another into ledger which is distributed and sync among miners. To have transaction one should have bitcoins, now you can buy bitcoins from exchanges or from users. But at the early stage nobody has bitcoin then how and who distributed it. 
hg6z9w5 comment >In layman languange, mining is just verification and recording of transaction from one user to another into ledger which is distributed and sync among miners.

Yes, they do that. But they also win **newly printed coins as a prize for winning a puzzle**. Reread my original comment. Miners win 6.25 BTC right now for every block mined. That's where the supply comes from. 
hg71ajt comment Originally it all came from the miners. Very first block comes with a block reward of 50BTC, then for the second block 50BTC more‚Ä¶ so on.  Miners held all the BTC in the beginning, then they send it to others. All the early bunch are miners and node runners and users and probably developers rolled into one. It was possible to mine using a laptop. Eventually a price was pegged to BTC based on the electricity cost to run those laptops, fractions of a cent. Then‚Ä¶ as more ppl accept bitcoin, the miners were able to sell their BTC for money to pay for their electricity and hardware cost‚Ä¶ and so on, that‚Äôs how BTC distributed in the early days. We now buy bitcoin from exchange but every sat began life as part of the block reward won by some miner 
q5nfr2 submission What does it mean to buy 1.6 billion BTC in less than 5 minutes?

q5ngls submission You ever wonder if Satoshi Nakamoto visits this sub? 
hg6vfeg comment My theory is that Sataohi is off in a Zen temple somewhere sweeping and mediating all day - fully enlightened and doesn‚Äôt give any fxxks about money, fame, or Bitcoin subs.

Or, he might be dead. 
hg79nrq comment The best thing Satoshi did after working on Bitcoin was to disappear. Let's hope we never find out who he is. 
hg84cca comment My fan theory is that Satoshi is a time traveller came back from the future to ‚Äúinvent‚Äù the monetary system the world is using. Then he returns to his time and owns like a quarter of the world‚Äôs economy. 
hg8prin comment Personally (and I am completely making this up), I believe satoshi is actually alive and well.  But he is a split personality of someone very smart and has since switched off or destroyed that personality so even he himself doesn't know he was satoshi and can't remember he had btc keys, let alone where/what the keys are. 
hg7518u comment Op is satoshi and he wants to  tell us how he feels and what hes been doing. 
hg7zv1m comment Quite frankly I think that anyone who has done what Satoshi did is either dead or has the type of personality that they monitor the entire ecosystem but never, and I mean *never*, involve themselves or even comment at all on what is happening. They started something that they didn‚Äôt want anyone in particular to control and I bet they abstain from potentially influencing it themselves anymore.

Fuck these VC anti bitcoiners antifreedom baffoons. 
hg72611 comment Lame 
hg761ll comment Seems very catastrophic and unrealistic. 
My objections:


1. The record of the bitcoin ledger is unparallel. So, if I want to buy a car or a house, I want my transaction to be there, recorded forever. 
A lot of people buy houses and a lot more people buy cars. So, the number of on-chain transactions would be a lot and it wouldn't be used by whales only.


2. To think that in the year 2100 blocks will contain 4000 transactions, so just double what they do today, seems very unlikely. Blocks were limited so that the blockchain would be very distributed. But when ssds of 10tb or so and fiber connections will be the norm, there won't be any reason not to make the blocks bigger. 
As of today you need around 300$ to run a node. Could you run a node with 32mb blocks? Yes of course. But you'd need 1000$ to do so and, in the worst case, having always full blocks, the blockchain would be 17 TB every ten years. So, with today hardware, very few people would run a node.


3. I certainly cannot predict the future, but I think it's reasonable to believe that in a scenario in which bitcoin has become the standard, there won't be parallel altcoins running like he assumes. 
hg7914v comment In his scenario, an average transaction fee of $85 would be the same security budget they have right now. Miners earning about $340k per block. $515 with his inflation. Why would miners stop if they were making $5M per block, almost 250% more than now with the inflation? The system self regulates to keep the chain going.

I've seen blocks this year with more than 4,000 transactions like this one https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/block/697882 - 4,209 transactions 

I'm sure in year 2100, the number of txs will be much, much higher than 4,000.



IIRC, the most txs in one block happened back in 2015 - block # 367853 (12,239 transactions - lots of empty ones!)

https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/block/367853 
hg7cu2t comment Yes that's due to segwit that increased the size of blocks virtually. But I'm sure that in the future due to hardware advancements blocks will be physically bigger.

hg7fqsx comment Morning all, quick one from me.

- I‚Äôve just installed Muun

- I‚Äôve just transferred the Satoshi tips I‚Äôve received via the LNTipBot.

- it was instantaneous and my mind is well and truly blown!

- My question. If I send Bitcoin via the traditional method to my Muun wallet am I able to send it on from there on the LN or is the process more complicated?

Thanks

The couple sold classified information regarding the designs of nuclear-powered warships to an individual they believed to represent a foreign nation. The contact was an undercover FBI agent who sent payments for the data in cryptocurrency.

q5q0hb submission El Salvador to build $4M veterinary hospital using profits from Bitcoin trust 
hg7avr3 comment tldr; El Salvador‚Äôs President Nayib Bukele has announced plans to invest part of the $4 million worth of profits the country has amassed from its Bitcoin holdings to invest into constructing a new veterinary hospital in the local capital of San Salvador. No Bitcoin will be sold to fund the investment, with the state instead drawing USD from its state-operated Bitcoin trust.

*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.* 
hg7irq4 comment You would think a country like El salvador has more pressing priorities then a pet shelter. 

They should just buy more bitcoin. 
hg8128y comment Although an animal hospital does seem like a strange choice, perhaps it's a more economic decision to provide new jobs (veterinaries, admin etc.) and service livestock to increase farming output? 
hg8br6g comment For everyone saying that it's a waste of money.
The hospital is going to accept bankers as patients when they have heart attacks after bitcoin takes over, ok?

hgb86n3 comment Can they not loan against the BTC. Surely hodl‚Äôing is the wisest move? 
hg89nhj comment look at all these selfish money hungry people on here. most of yall are so sheltered and pampered that yall dont really understand his decisions. im from el salvador and most of you dont understand that there is little to no animal healthcare there. sick animals can spread illnesses among people. these creatures are finally going to have somewhere they can be treated. aside from him building hospitals for humans and schools, opening a pet hospital will show people compassion. it seems dumb to those who dont understand how society works and have so much greed that they are blinded just thinking about stacking money. getting mad at el salvador for building a pet hospital but not giving a damn about the US using money for war and policing and many other useless things is a morbidly funny thing to me. el salvador is rebuilding itself, it would be in a good place if the US hadn't started civil wars in all central america destabilizing most of those countries just so they could open a drug highway and steal resources. currency of all forms is meant to be spent on good things like infrastructure. what, is there also going to be an outrage when he builds water purification plants and other things that build a stable society? progress is slow, and all of the good things bukele has done are overlooked. i dont agree with alot of things he does but he's the only president who hasn't just filled his own pockets with money that should be used to rebuild a nation.

q5qez8 submission I'm pretty new on this 
hg7dxaa comment Buy a small amount as play money and practice sending it to wallets you own. Aka make a bunch of wallets and send your $25 back and forth.

This will help you get comfortable with the tech in a low risk environment.

After tinkering around for a bit you'll have some pointed questions I can help you with. 
hg7cevz comment Congrats on the move, it's never too late. ONLY INVEST MONEY YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE.

Price wise, nobody knows what the price will be tomorrow, nor next week. Statistically, it's less than four years from now. Anyone who bought Bitcoin at any point in the past and held it for 4+ years is in profit. 

**Try "Bitcoin ONLY" strategy for at least first year**, you'll sleep much better. Newcomers lose so much money, holding garbage tokens just because someone on YT told them to.

Going DCA is probably the best approach, IMHO. 
Bitcoin to me, is a savings account. If I have some spare cash, I exchange it for SATs. Once a week works best for me, but I'm getting paid weekly. If there's a 10% drop in the price since my last buy, I usually double my buy. This [DCA calculator](https://amber.app/calculate-your-investment/) might help to decide what will work best for you. In a few years, even $10 dollars a month can make a massive difference.

Now, don't buy a fake Bitcoin at etoro, RH, PayPal or similar, get the real thing. Register at a proper exchange and buy real Bitcoin. Any of these will do [https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin](https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin) 

Install (or buy - in case you're getting Bitcoin in Thousands of $) one or more of these wallets.

A few good wallet choices:

[https://blockstream.com/green/](https://blockstream.com/green/) \- Top Security Features, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://bluewallet.io](https://bluewallet.io/) \- excellent, easy to use wallet, Open Source and Non-Custodial (although, Lightning is custodial!)

[https://www.wasabiwallet.io/](https://www.wasabiwallet.io/) \- Excellent privacy, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets.

Lightning wallets to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for very small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix 

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - excellent POS for small business owners as well as integrated Bitrefill or LN Pizza

[https://muun.com/](https://muun.com/) \- Muun, simple and elegant LN wallet

Hardware Wallets (to store larger amounts):

[https://trezor.io/](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're.

[https://coldcardwallet.com/](https://coldcardwallet.com/) \- ColdCaard is currently the safest and most recommended here.

There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend as not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, etc. Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. 

Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. Write them down on any piece of paper as well as the receiving address. Now wipe the wallet and generate a new wallet. If the seed words are different than the first set, you're safe to use it. 

Find an option to set a passphrase and use it. This will boost the security to another level. Never store the seed words and passphrase together. Use a different medium if possible. If somebody finds both, they'll be able to steal your coin. 

This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words and passphrase(s) safe.

Welcome to the rabbit hole and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions anytime during your Bitcoin journey.

Most altcoins have failed, meanwhile bitcoin has always had good return on investment and in my opinion it is also one of the safest cryptos to invest

hg7kqvs comment me too„ÄÇmaybe we can chat more about cryption 
hg7nywg comment Learn as much as possible.  Turns out knowledge and the conviction that comes with it is really really helps when investing in cutting edge tech that is extremely volatile.  Here‚Äôs my favorite resources.

Hearing multiple different experts views through the eyes of many podcasters seems to be a good way to develop understanding.  Some podcasts have things that others miss because of their perspectives.  

Podcasts: . 

Bitcoin Audible(I‚Äôd start here)-Reads the best papers and articles etc in the space and unpacks them.  (Start with Gradually then Suddenly, The Bullish case for Bitcoin, and maybe some Gladstein articles) Beginner to advanced. Hardcore Bitcoiner. Because most good articles are read here, I won‚Äôt bother listing the best papers in this post, just check out his episode list if you want to read rather than listen. 

The Investor‚Äôs Podcast-advanced bitcoin macroeconomics, and traditional investing. 

Swan Signal-More great intermediate and advanced Bitcoin knowledge. Hardcore Bitcoiners. 

What Bitcoin Did-A Beginner/Intermediate guide.  Foul language warning.

Lets Talk Bitcoin-How Bitcoin can help freedom, and help underserved and unbanked

Tales From The Crypt- Hardcore Bitcoiners and miners with current events.

Top guests to listen to in the podcasts(there are probably many others but these are the ones that stand out imo):  Bitcoin and Macro: Michael Saylor,  Luke Gromen, Lyn Alden, Nic Carter, Alex Gladstein, Jeff Booth, Preston Pysh, Dan Held, Greg Foss, Nik Bahtia, Andrew Quittem, Parker Lewis, Raoul Pal, Vijay Boyapati, Gigi, Andy Edstrom   Chain Analysis: Willy Woo, William Clemente(kraken and glassnode also have a chain analysis newsletter)   Tech gurus: Andreas Antonopolous, Jameson Lopp, Adam Back, Nick Szabo, Shinobi, Jack Mallers, Matt Odell/MartyBent, Andrew Poelstra, Andreas Antonopolous especially.

Books: The Bitcoin Standard(great intro book), Layered Money, The Internet of Money(great intro book), Debt the First 5000 Years, Inventing Bitcoin, 21 lessons What Ive learned from Bitcoin, The price of Tomorrow, The Bullish Case For Bitcoin(great intro book) and The Blocksize Wars were good.

Resource pages: https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information.html and https://www.lopp.net/lightning-information.html

Publications: Bitcoin Magazine 

This isn‚Äôt an exhaustive list, just the best ones I have honed in on so far. Several runners up Podcasts if you want more; Pomp, Real Vision, Stephan Livera Podcast, Bitcoin Magazine Podcast, Bitcoin made Simple, Bitcoin Matrix, What is Money, Bitcoin Knowledge, Citizen Bitcoin, Bitcoin Sessions, On the Brink, and Bitcoin Standard Podcast.

* Is it safe?
* Is it legal?
* If yes, does it require id or phone number or name to work? Or is it completely anonymous?

Also, do you need an ATM (big machine) or is a type of PoS enough, in cooperation with an existing store inside the station?

I remember there is a company that sell tiny machines, that work like the ones that topup mobile phones.

You know, you insert the amount and it prints a paper with the info on it.

hg7hecu comment i believe it is soon, just because it shot up a lot doesn't necessarily mean there i will be a big crash following it. 
hg7htjk comment We are approaching extreme greed in Fear And Greed Index, this means there will be probably a correction soon, and another pump lately that will finally bring the price to a new all time high. Peace ‚úåüèº 
I would also try to bring out the fact that is risky just to think about going up, the best thing right now is to think if there is any potential risk in the system.
Like stocks collapse and bitcoin temporarily collapsing too, to reach new all time high lately, or the mistery about ~1M store of Satoshi, and if that could represent a problem if Satoshi Nakamoto is not a fair individual but (maybe) a government like China trying to pose an hoax on us all.
Thinking stuff like that gives us a timing advantage to buy low and update/upgrade bitcoin system to make it even more solid and more resilient toward these probable risks.

Tether is also a big mistery and for sure they did some sketchy things.
Nowadays I think about tether like the most genius individuals on earth because they rigged the system, backed by themselves society, shown false proof of something they never had. ü§£
But if this manoeuvres will be good ones in the long term they are welcome.
They played the most bad game on earth which is financial manipulation but they played really well, so.
Tether is a scam, but a really good one, and hope that they scammed financial system and Wall Street and won‚Äôt collapse.
They consolidated a fortune doing sketchy things. But think like that:
Is this not what bankers and Wall Street whales have done for centuries ?
Personally I like tether moves üëç

q5rsx7 submission Why are the fees higher if you are trading large amounts of bitcoin? 
hg7jhov comment You mean buying from an centralised exchange? Nothing to do with network fees. Those are exchange fees which are % of amt bought 
hg7jlsg comment Exchanges are different from miners.

The exchanges let you buy and sell, the miners are to do with the network 
hg7x5pc comment Both numbers you quoted are around .1% of the total amount purchased....sounds like an exchange transaction fee... Exchanges gotta make money too 
hg7ssfa comment As others have said, there are 2 types of fees

* Exchange fees: they charge flat (e.g. $5/transaction) or percent (e.g. 1% of transacted value) usually
* Bitcoin network transaction fees

Transaction fees on the network are chosen by you and can be whatever you want them to be.  A block can only include a certain number of bytes, which means a miner will want to maximize the **fee per byte** of included transactions, rather than the fee per transaction or fee per BTC transferred, in order to get the most out of mining.

A transaction's size is comprised of a relatively fixed overhead + variable inputs and outputs.  So to keep your transaction size small, you want to make the inputs and outputs as few as possible.

This is where the disconnect between value transferred and ins/outs happens.  Because you can imagine a miner in 2010 getting a 50 BTC reward and sending it all to someone will have a very small transaction size (1 in, the coinbase he got in 2010, and 1 out), while someone transferring 0.1 BTC today from an exchange hot wallet to their own cold wallet will have a larger transaction size, as the exchange will have frankensteined together say 5-10 other outputs to make that 0.1 BTC, and those all have to be inputs in your transaction.

When an exchange charges you to transfer from them to your own wallet, they're taking the above into account with the fee they extract.  They pay the network fee, and charge you the flat/% fee. 
hg7xnii comment  It‚Äôs the size (byte) not size ($) that drives the price. 
q5rtt1 submission anyone got a safe bitcoin mixer 
q5rult submission Should I be worried if I clicked a scam link? 
hg7k8d7 comment Is there any particular reason not to update all your shit and run every malware/anti virus you got? Bro this is your *money* we're talking about, nobody is going to give it back if you fucked up. There ain't no hotline to call and be like "someone stole my login can you reverse the transactions please." 

Bitcoin is secure *because* nobody else has your keys. If you think you're about to give those keys away, activate red alert and act like the threat is real. What other response can we give? 
hg7josu comment You should be very worried. You have no idea how sophisticated the attacks are now 
hg7k4lx comment We all have malware and jailbroken devices as clearly said by McAfee just by watching pornography.
I will think about stacking all your crypto on a ledger which is incorruptible if set up properly. 
hg7kf0n comment I find blockfi feature that permits you to do an allowing list and wait 7 days to transfer your fund to another wallet VERY VERY USEFUL.
The only thing you can do if you are very panicking is to check the allow listing addresses each 3/4 days and see if there‚Äôs any fake address.
No one can take you anything with this feature üí° 
hg7kuad comment There's nothing to worry about if you just clicked the link without submitting and information. Anything otherwise would mean your browser has a critical security flaw. 
hg7opwu comment Absolutely. 
hg7kdlx comment Nope, I can even reset the PC back to factory settings if necessary. Just wondering if simply clicking a website could really install a malware to stole my crypto or if that is just trying to phish me in sending them crypto 
hg7jxjf comment Even if I just clicked on the link? I read that they try to make you send crypto "to verify" your address before sending you their "prize worth $xx xxx" in BTC. So I guess there is no issue by just clicking on the link? If not, would resetting my PC to factory would be a solution? 
hg7kyz5 comment That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking but still wondering if people got their crypto stolen just by clicking a link. I‚Äôm resetting my pc just to be sure 
hg7mzau comment If you didn't download any file or provided any personal Info, no harm is done. Don't worry.

hg7noq2 comment The CCP needs to go away (esp Xinnie the Pooh). They‚Äôre literally going to undo all of China‚Äôs success over the last 40 years if they become this totalitarian 
hg7xy22 comment Maybe now I can buy another miner. For the casual home garage miner, buying one has been nearly impossible.
