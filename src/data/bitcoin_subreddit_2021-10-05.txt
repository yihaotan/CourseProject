q1izh2 submission I started 4 days ago investing in Bitcoins 
hff716y comment I don't know if swan Bitcoin is available where you live but that's what I use. $250 every two weeks and they seem very safe and secure. 
hff9wmj comment Bitcoin frees your money. See it as a savings account instead of a stock you're trading. Bitcoin is better than fiat, so you probably wouldn't want to buy fiat with it.

> For my second investment I’m planing of investing more into crypto currencies but I’m just unsure how and when

The vast majority of other coins are just scams. The safest way to keep your wealth is to just buy more Bitcoin. Most people that trade end up losing money in the long term, plus they have complex tax issues, hundreds or thousands of transactions, a lot in fees, etc. Saving in Bitcoin is by far the easiest and simplest method.

> I live in Europe (The Netherlands) would you advise me sticking up with one the same trading app (using Bitvavo because they offer iDEAL deposit) or spread my chances across different trading exchange companies?

[Bitonic](https://bitonic.nl/) seems to be a very good place for buying Bitcoin there. [They've said good things about it in reddit](https://www.reddit.com/domain/bitonic.nl/) and it's listed in [bitcoin-only](https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin)

Since you're in The Netherlands have a look at [making some free Bitcoins with your purchases](https://www.withlightning.com/blog/2021/08/26/get-satsback/), basically cash back but with Bitcoin. That way you will get a bit of extra Bitcoin for free.

2.now don’t answer any pm’s offering help. 
3 in this sub it’s advised bitcoin only. Everything else are shitcoins. 
4. Only invest what you can afford to Hodl. 
5. Keep investing in bitcoin and Hodl don’t lend. 
6. In the US so can’t advise. I’m sure others will chime in. 

You said ‘fack it’ and joined the club. Nice!  Welcome.

Oh well.  

Here we are.  **Welcome to Bitcoin!!** 
hff8wr6 comment DCA via Bittr.ag . It's actually founded by a Dutch guy and works amazing. It doesn't require much KYC too because they are based in Switzerland. 
hffc2qu comment Welcome to the rabbit hole. You have plenty of company but much more to come the next decade. Research a plan that works for you and stick with it. You got this. 
hffco3b comment Investing in bitcoin is the clear choice and I would recommend you to hold it for the long term because bitcoin is very volatile. 
hffg8fa comment Imagine if you just DCAd from the jump. 
hfgvy21 comment Blox also got ideal and you can get €10 free to start with, for us Dutch people that is hard to resist. (message me when interested in the €10)


Blox also say they store they crypto on a cold wallet, bitvavo does that to i think. But can't stake, bitvavo does. And can't sent or get crypto on blox, what is possible on bitvavo. Fees are low on both

I got both, but prefer bitvavo for more options. I buy every month a small amount, when i reach a certain amount i can put it on my own cold wallet and that is the best option i think.

hffa3y1 comment tldr; Paul Opoku: Bitcoin was, and is, a historic accident, kind of like the discovery of fire by our ancestors. He says that Bitcoin is growing at a faster rate than the internet in the early 1990s. Opoku believes that Bitcoin will reach $1,000,000 per coin within the next four years.

hff8ai8 comment Thank goodness, I was so concerned about this. 🤦‍♂️ 
hffait3 comment If you buy today, you are literally buying the top for next year or two. Expect btc to loos its value by literally 50% this coming year. It may go up to 50 to 51k but it's going down and that's OK.

Edit: oh no did I get the people who bought at the literal top mad because I said btc will drop below 30k lmao. Cope.
Btcs down fall will be that most people don't actually spend it and just hold.

hffc7bm comment So u think btc will continue to rise past 50k this year? I'm saying that if you buy btc now on this 2nd bull wave between 49k to 52k you are buying the top. 
q1jdxm submission Is Laetitude a Scam? (I'm not 100% sure) 
hff8w71 comment We have a lot of newcomers entering the Bitcoin space recently who are exploring different exchanges and such. Some users are developing a habit of asking if various random websites some complete stranger PM'd them is a scam or not. Sometimes these sites are completely unrelated to Bitcoin. This is not the purpose of r/Bitcoin.

* Do not trust unsolicited messages telling you to check out some shady website.
* Do not trust Discord randos telling you that you won a prize.
* Do not trust anyone who promises guaranteed profits.
* Do not trust website with unpronounceable domain names
* Do not trust anyone claiming to give away free Bitcoin. (YouTube, Twitter, Discord)
* Do not trust anyone claiming they will double however much Bitcoin you send them.
* Do not trust 'pretty girls' on Tinder telling you about new investment opportunities.
* **If you have to ask** if some sketchy website or special offer is a scam, **then it probably is.**

You have to learn to think for yourselves. Recognize that there are many tricksters out there who will go to great lengths to separate you from your Bitcoin. Use your head and stay safe. If you send your Bitcoin to a scammer, it's gone forever. There are no refunds!

hfgplj5 comment 0.   Avoid central exchanges then you don't have these kind of discrimination problems and you stay safe. If you KYC on a central exchange then it's only a question of time when your data are hacked or a corrupt employee sells it in the dark net to local criminals who might knock on your door with the expectation that you give them the seed of your well encrypted wallet. See [https://github.com/jlopp/physical-bitcoin-attacks](https://github.com/jlopp/physical-bitcoin-attacks) . 

1. You can ask the trade partner from what address he intends to send the bitcoin and investigate the history of this coin in a block explorer
2. Privacy: If you use central exchanges then your privacy is an open book: [https://btctester.com/bitcoin-privacy-check/](https://btctester.com/bitcoin-privacy-check/)
3. Depends on whom you ask. For central exchanges it's a red flag. Decentral exchanges don't care about. P2P trade partners usually don't care or have no chance to challenge it, for privacy focused people it's like heaven, for me as a bitcoin detective coinjoin is a little challenge (while I cannot break the algorithm I catch fraudsters using it frequently  because earlier or later most of them do a mistake in co-spending the wrong coins and revealing their privacy) 
hffr8xe comment If it were me I’d probably just buy some kyc free coin from your friend, and some from the exchange, vary your ratio depends on what you value most.

So, -50% discount for fat boys - and let Average Joe try to compete there...

Agree or not - but that's not the Satoshi's vision, for sure...

hfgdmn8 comment So you think a description of a temporary state is a dictatorial decree for the entire world to set aside normal economic reality? And now you're bitching that the universe doesn't adhere to it? Wtf are you on?

You're discrediting Satoshi immensely here. 
hfgenpd comment No, you are discrediting Satoshi immensely here.

There wouldn't be Bitcoin at all - if Satoshi was inline with your so-called: *"normal economic reality"*... ;)

Bitcoin is all about free from censorship - and there is an elephant in the room i.e. Bitmain's monkey ASIC business (talking about "temporary state" btw, do you remember their "support" for Segwit?).

I bet Satoshi wouldn't like to hide this elephant, definitely.

Maybe [ASIC from Blockstream] (https://blockstream.com/2021/08/24/en-blockstream-mining-builds-momentum-with-spondoolies-acquisition/) will fix it, hopefully...

hfgcmx6 comment It’s such a huge psychological target. I’m not interested in what happens after it hits it. Maybe it runs to 150k then crashes down to 60k. Who knows. But the fact that it hit 6 figures at any point in history is massive and will send alarm bells running through the financial world like never before that this thing is here to stay. It will be all over the news, people will read about it and think “oh my god is this still a thing” after not hearing about it for months/years. Then the FOMO starts. People start fantasising about $1m coin. It pumps like crazy, but falls short by some way. It drops like a stone from $550k down to $90k. Newbies are bleeding like crazy. People have lost loads of money. All the bears are laughing saying I told you it was a scam/dead. Newspapers get bored and stealth mode starts again. The next time it crosses $100k, nobody cares…We’ve seen it before. 

Rinse and repeat until $10m or whatever. Who cares? I’m never selling… 
hffp7d3 comment Well by then 1 sat will be worth 0.001 dollars. 
hffmoea comment I really think it depends how quickly it gets there.  

If we enter a low vol bull market where it slowly works its way to 100k over the next few months creating multiple support levels along the way then i expect a small pullback.

Now if it rockets to 100k in 3wks then I'd expect a large pullback to 60k.

Or it just rockets straight through to 150k, nobody fin knows, just hodl

q1lh6d submission Within the past month, The Fed has been aggressively pushing forward its creation of CBDC. It seemed to be on the back burner up until now. Why do you think they are all of a sudden moving forward with CBDC? 
hffq249 comment With CBDCs, the central banks are no longer constrained by interest rates, as the CBDCs allow them to more easily drop interest rates below zero. Currently cash notes that are circulating in the system act as a lower bound on interest rates. In order to reduce cash in circulation, the banks have theorized creating a dual system where buying goods with cash would cost $103 whereas using the digital currency would cost $100, disincentiving the use of cash. This has been in consideration for a decade, so I wouldn't say it's "all of a sudden." They'll be able to lower interest rates, bring on universal basic income and debase the currency. Nom nom for Central bankers

hffzeau comment It kinda makes sense...

First, the current world millionaires cannot all have 1 Bitcoin, as they are more than 21M. That's already a bit exclusive.

[About 4 Million coins are lost forever](https://decrypt.co/37171/lost-bitcoin-3-7-million-bitcoin-are-probably-gone-forever), and that number will just continue to rise, forever, never going down.

There's only [about 2M Bitcoins left to be mined](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/how-many-bitcoins-are-there/).

Some companies and whales are buying as much as they can.

Price probably will go up.

So, yeah, 400k sounds about right. Maybe not exact, but it's definitely an exclusive club.

hffu9kl comment It’s like he knows from experience… 
hffy49f comment Are we still listening to the talking monkey? 
hfg1i9y comment > On Tuesday, Musk seemed to acknowledge his limited expertise on the industry: “I wouldn’t say that I’m a massive cryptocurrency expert,” said Musk. “I think there’s some value in cryptocurrency, but I wouldn’t say it’s the second coming of the Messiah.”

Crypto is increasingly impactful.

In my opinion, it is, for example, going to completely change the ballgame in business.

However, most corporations currently fail to see how to use it to structure their trade operations.

For example, it has the capacity to completely replace the existing system of [letters of credit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_of_credit). That alone would be earth shaking.

It can also completely replace the existing [correspondent banking system](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondent_account). That would be another earth-shaking evolution.

It can also entirely replace the current system of custodians and (primary) brokers in the stock exchange.

Multisignature markets make the online use of credit cards obsolete. 

And the list goes on and on ...

If you just look at what we can already do with the five standard smart contracts, i.e. payment, multisig, atomic swap, ico (colored coin/token), lightning deposit/withdrawal, it will soon become a totally different world out there.

Furthermore, every single new smart-contract type that painstakingly gets discovered over time creates a brand new multi-billion dollar industry.

Elon Musk simply has no vision nor foresight on the matter.

Else n Musk does not realize that he now said something along the lines of  "640K ought to be enough for anybody." or even "I think there's a world market for maybe five computers."

hfg1jlx comment **[Letter of credit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_of_credit)** 
 
 >A letter of credit (LC), also known as a documentary credit or bankers commercial credit, or letter of undertaking (LoU), is a payment mechanism used in international trade to provide an economic guarantee from a creditworthy bank to an exporter of goods. Letters of credit are used extensively in the financing of international trade, when the reliability of contracting parties cannot be readily and easily determined. Its economic effect is to introduce a bank as an underwriter that assumes the counterparty risk of the buyer paying the seller for goods.

hffvkua comment Here's a link to the article (it goes on for a lot longer): [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-bears-control-114428414.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-bears-control-114428414.html)

Like, are they even pretending there is any theory to this? I would like to track results of such predictions over time, but there is really nothing to track, just a lot of: "it might go up a little, and if it does, it might go up some more, or it might go back down. And if it goes down, it could go down further. And if it goes down really far, it's either going to keep going down or go back up, maybe quickly.

It's just like successful fortune telling: Make enough vague guesses that no matter what happens you're covered—totally nailed it. The one problem is that they have to take a stand on the headline or no one will click. In this case, it was dead wrong: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-bears-control-114428414.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-bears-control-114428414.html)

But I predict that their future headlines will break through the next resistance band and be mostly right—maybe even a string of very correct headlines. But on the other hand if we continue break through the support of this current wrong headline there could be more wrong headlines below, potentially a lot of them. If neither of those things happen, we will see a period of both correct and incorrect headlines that will last for some amount of time. But we'll have to read the stories for more details.

q1p1ts submission is it a scam? 
hfg9gye comment We have a lot of newcomers entering the Bitcoin space recently who are exploring different exchanges and such. Some users are developing a habit of asking if various random websites some complete stranger PM'd them is a scam or not. Sometimes these sites are completely unrelated to Bitcoin. This is not the purpose of r/Bitcoin.

* Do not trust unsolicited messages telling you to check out some shady website.
* Do not trust Discord randos telling you that you won a prize.
* Do not trust anyone who promises guaranteed profits.
* Do not trust website with unpronounceable domain names
* Do not trust anyone claiming to give away free Bitcoin. (YouTube, Twitter, Discord)
* Do not trust anyone claiming they will double however much Bitcoin you send them.
* Do not trust 'pretty girls' on Tinder telling you about new investment opportunities.
* **If you have to ask** if some sketchy website or special offer is a scam, **then it probably is.**

You have to learn to think for yourselves. Recognize that there are many tricksters out there who will go to great lengths to separate you from your Bitcoin. Use your head and stay safe. If you send your Bitcoin to a scammer, it's gone forever. There are no refunds!

q1p7ay submission How many btc to become financially free? 
hfgbwam comment **₿6.15 is apparently the magic number.**

Before anyone asks:
It’s just a meme, started by the Twitter person known as American HODL.

It was in response to this tweet from CZ, the CEO of Bincance:

https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1165533865554804739

If you own 1 BTC, you are mathematically guaranteed to be top 3/1000 richest in the world, in BTC terms. (21m / 7B).

The response:

If you own 6.15 BTC, you are guaranteed to get lots of “bitches” with “big titties”.

It's quite pointless to link to American HODL, he gets banned almost every month. 
hfgg4u6 comment 4.2069 
hfgn8ox comment If you assume that 1 BTC is approximately 1 year's middle-class salary, and that taxes take roughly half of that, then 1 BTC is approximately 2 years of freedom, without any growth.

If you can assume a rate of growth that is greater than 25% per year (so far, this is over 100%), then 2 BTC is enough to never run out, while living a middle-class life. 
hfhj7vc comment Currently global wealth distribution looks like this:

Top 1% holds 41% of all wealth

Next 8% holds 42% of all wealth

Next 23% holds 14% of all wealth

Bottom 68% holds 3% of all wealth

If bitcoin were to be distributed in the same way this is how much btc each of those groups would own (assuming a population of 8 billion people).

Top 1% would own 8,610,000 btc 
(0.1076 btc per person)

Next 8% would own 8,820,000 btc 
(0.0137 btc per person)

Next 23% would own 2,940,000 btc 
(0.0015 btc per person)

Bottom 68% would own 630,000 btc 
(0.0001 btc per person)

Owning 0.1 btc ($5,000 today) would put you in the top 1% of the global population should bitcoin become used as a global reserve currency.

I would say its safe to assume anyone with 0.5 btc or more is going to be not just financially free but possibly able to create generational wealth they can hand down to their kids and grand kids.

Never use central exchanges like e.g. Binance because you cannot control your bitcoin there. There are more and more users reporting that the exchange is blocking their coins without giving a reason.

As per Binance, the transfer fee was 0.00022. I don’t know what you’re on about when it’s clearly the platform LB. I searched LB after posting, and found people had similar experiences everywhere and, on Reddit.

This sentence alone is... I don't know what to say:

"In the short-term view of the BTC contract in the day, it has risen and fallen yesterday, which means that the future strength still needs to cooperate with it."

You should do something else with your time. 
hfgi6u2 comment What bottom? According to my spreadsheet, I bought BTC for €25610 on January 4th (first buy this year).

And I don't even need to look at my buying prices of the past few years (I buy every Monday) to know that we're in a long term bull trend; for me personally, it is absolutely irrelevant if we get to $48900 this week or not. Whatever happens in three months from now comes first.

hfgy32y comment Less thinking, more buying ;) 
hfh1ef5 comment I hate to be "that guy".

But on the one hand you're saying you realise you can never time the swings, and on the other hand you're asking how to time your buying and selling alongside the swings using indicators.

Essentially, your post can be boiled down to "how can I make a profit trading BTC?"

Unfortunately, if anyone has a consistently correct answer to that question they're already living the good life in the Bahamas, and are unlikely to share their secrets.

You're going the right way about it with contrarian thinking (being greedy while others are fearful, thanks Warren Buffett), but outside of that, DCA is the only consistent way to level out the volatility. 
hfh5ad5 comment As they say, "time IN the market beats timING the market."  

The long term average ROI for holding Bitcoin is 135% per year.  Do the math.

2.35^8 = 930

That says, invest a thousand, wait 8 years (give or take), watch it grow (with volatility) to about one million dollars. 
hfghz2c comment Buying is always easy because on long enough timescale, Bitcoin tends to end up higher.
Selling (buying back fiat) is much more risky, especially in the bull part of the cycle we are right now in. 
hfglv07 comment What’s the fear and greed at right now? 
hfhlkxc comment Since you've already been in for 3 years, could you share how effective your system has been so far? 
hfinb0d comment Long term = never sell. Determine your start capital and buy. Convince yourself to buy monthly on the dips. Every month look for the earliest reversal on a decent pullback (> 10%) and buy. If it keeps dropping buy at end of the month. Do not buy when it's rising, in that case build your cash position (= like taking profits). This is my long term strategy. To increase cash position short-term you should learn to trade and follow the trend.

hfic5wy comment Like you’ve never attacked or criticized something you don’t fully understand. 
hficz81 comment No.  I don't do that.  

If I don't understand something, I keep my stupid mouth shut.  

For example, I'm in a bar the guys on either side of me are bickering about the salaries of certain Cricket players.  I have a vague idea of what Cricket is and I've watched maybe 30 minutes of Cricket in my entire life.  Thus, I keep my stupid mouth shut.  I don't jump in there and say, "Oh, so-and-so is such a lazy clown..."  I'm not like you, Kevin, and other people who DO that sort of thing.  


When I have a disagreement, I consider that I might know things the other person does not yet know, and that the other person might know things I don't know yet.  I'm open to listening and learning... if there's anything to be learned. 
q1sejm submission get free btc anytime anywhere 
q1semf submission what is the difference in cost, say right now, between sending 0.1BTC and 1 BTC? 
hfgwind comment The balance does not matter, the UTXOs matter.

Think of it like this.  You want to mail $100 to a friend.  Are you sending your friend a $100 bill or are you sending a $50 bill, $20 bill, 10 Dollar Coins, and $20 in quarters?  You will pay more to send all the coins because the envelope is higher in weight.

It’s the same way with UTXOs.  If your 1 BTC is a single UTXO it can be less data and cheaper to transfer than a smaller amount made up of multiple UTXOs.

Check out this book:
https://www.inventingbitcoin.com/ 
hfgjzuv comment It depends on how large your input UTXOs are, and whether they are native segwit, wrapped segwit or legacy UTXOs 
hfgmbqy comment If you think of bitcoin as actual physical coins, then the more physical coins you need to send, the higher the fee will be. If you have a 0.1btc coin and a 1btc coin, then sending one or the other will cost the exact same.

If your 1 bitcoin is in fact 2x 0.5 bitcoins, then it will cost more in fees to send that 1 bitcoin (total).
And the same goes for the 0.1btc. If it is in fact 2 coins of 0.05btc or 10 coins of 0.01btc, then it will cost more than sending that one 1bitcoin coin you have.

Taking it back to the digital paradigm. A physical coin in my example above is expressed as an UTXO or '~~unidentified~~ unspent transaction output'. 
hfgit3q comment No difference whatsoever. 
hfgqjjk comment Amount does not affect transaction fee. 
hfgwfqn comment Just the amount of data you are sending in plain English which correlates to the 1st comment.   Of course you can further deep dive into the lightning network and it's benefits.

hfgjlo1 comment No fee difference, but we have the opportunity cost. You send someone 0.1BTC now, that's okayish. You send someone 1 BTC now, then in 5 years, you realize you sent them half a mill. OUCH!

hfk2zzk comment Can people with a Z2 claim do this?

I kinda stopped following the sub after awhile since someone said my Z2 claim wouldn't never see any form of rebate. Not sure why I have such a crappy claim since I've always replied to every email etc. 
hfi3l4i comment This is wrong, it is the other way round. If there are less then 50% of yes votes the civil rehabilitation fails, and we are back to bankruptcy proceedings where everyone gets $400 per bitcoin. All the remaining assets (i.e. the remaining bitcoin) go to the owner of Mt. Gox!

If you want your share of the remaining bitcoin, you need to vote with YES. 
hfholjs comment Not exactly "still free" considering he did do time in prison. 
hfkyaor comment > All the remaining assets (i.e. the remaining bitcoin) go to the owner of Mt. Gox! 
hfiwfq6 comment This is wrong.  They are going to steal your money somehow... Some way. 
hfhv77j comment Did he?  I know they took his passport, and they may have held him in jail until he bailed himself out.  I don't recall him getting any criminal conviction.

Edit:

https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/japan-court-backs-karpeles-conviction-data-manipulation-71211400

So he's been convicted, but the sentence was suspended.  He did sit in jail for 11 months while awaiting trial, but that's not quite the same as having been convicted and "do[ing] time in prison."  Unless he screws up again, he won't actually have to serve prison time as a convicted criminal.

The brokers who have this option are Coinexx, Onada, and FXCC. These brokers have these options on their platform. Other than these, a broker has no other role to play in the forex market.  
" 
q1thsc submission 50!! Nice to be back 
q1tk4a submission El Salvador is proving that Bitcoin is also a currency. The reclassification of Bitcoin as nothing but an asset by governments is a direct attack on Satoshi's ultimate dream. We must always remember and fight for BTC's right to be an Electronic Cash not an Electronic Asset. 
hfgp5ht comment All in good time. **Store of value** first. **Medium of exchange** later. 
hfgpet8 comment Bitcoin is not a currency, it's legal tender in El Salvador.

The main difference is that there's no central authority managing its monetary policy. This means that, for example, the IMF cannot buy Bitcoin, since it can only buy currencies of its members. 
hfhemj8 comment The way I see it is that Bitcoin was created as a way to opt out. And if you opt out by using it as a means of transaction or store of value, or both, doesn't matter. The important thing is that Bitcoin allows you to opt out.  Just my personal opinion 
hfhfubs comment On the contrary, from what I understand Satoshi saw it more of an asset than a real currency.  I think all hard money has to start as an asset and then the real currency forms as a layer two tied to the hard asset 
hfh0rm9 comment Let it be whatever we need it to be. 
hfh5lbq comment So how does *Sustainability* comes in ?

I believe usability strengthens a lasting sustainability 
hfhe6aa comment Are there any metrics being tracked to watch the transacting rates in El Salvador? It would be amazing to have some graphs and charts that show the increasing adoption and usage of bitcoin by more individuals. 

Does anyone know if that information is captured and published anywhere? 
hfgp2uq comment Craig? 
hfh07mg comment Give Defi another year or two, and watch the collective heads of Congress explode 
hfhezdz comment The law says it should be classified as a currency since el salvador made it their currency. The question is who will sue for this recognition, if no-one does then be sure no-one in the government will either.

hfiiofp comment STOP!!! If you do not understand this web page by reading it, you certainly are not in a position to be out on the internet trying to anonymize your Bitcoin. You are going to be scammed eventually if you are so caviler with your Bitcoin. Put your Bitcoin in cold storage and hold. You can always screw with it later after you learn more. Quit fucking around. 
hfj36gt comment yay! lets send uncensorable money to random internet page.

hfi7hq7 comment BTC is already *fairly* anonymous.  In that as long as you aren’t advertising your shit, no one knows what you have.

If you’re referring to anonymizing it from KYC exchanges, what are you trying to do?

These types of services are ripe with fraud. 
hfi3bcm comment The field on the left purports to return your bitcoin if something goes wrong before the trade happens. The one on the right is where it says it will send your new bitcoin, post-trade. 
hfjosp5 comment A Bitcoin address is a single-use token. A Bitcoin wallet has thousands of addresses. Use different addresses for these two 
hfl4q03 comment Use Wasabi... 
hfpi5kj comment I was just accumulating information, haven't done shit yet. I just want to know what these things mean. But the thing is, I can't hold it much longer. Right now, my government KNOWS about my BTC and before it gains too much value, I really need to anonymize it. If I do it later, my government will already knock on my door asking for whatever. So later is not an option, I think.

Once it's anonymous, yes I will put it on (a) paper wallet(s). 
hfphzat comment I got my BTC from a KYC exchange, so I really need to anonymize it. I get that it's hard to trust these kind of services. I thought of sending it in smaller amounts, to a 'respected' service. With this one, I was just learning how it works.
