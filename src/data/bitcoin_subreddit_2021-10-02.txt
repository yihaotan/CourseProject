pzks8j submission I just converted all of my gold to Bitcoin. 
hf1j1dj comment At 17%, you already made more than gold in the last ten years. (Gold gained 8% in ten.) Hooray. 
hf1kdn3 comment If you were able to HODL gold for 10 years, you have the skills to become very wealthy with BTC. 
hf1hgnn comment You were trying to do the right thing, and before Bitcoin, gold was the right kind of thing.  

You're intelligent enough to realize, "Hey, this isn't working like I planned."  

You're going to be very, very happy with Bitcoin -- certainly after the next ten years. 
hf1jm8e comment Someday I'm going to count the number of posts in /r/gold about people selling their BTC for gold and compare it to the number of posts in /r/bitcoin from people selling their gold for BTC. I think they're about equal.

I like both though. I have a bunch of physical gold (and silver!) and a bunch of BTC. Plus stocks and real estate. Keeping all of your eggs in one basket is kind of a dumb move. 
hf1limu comment Well, gold is still much more solid than $. You could've done much worse like keeping your moeny on, so-called, "saving" account.

My bank \[a second-largest bank in Europe\] has offered me a whopping 0.05 % APR... 
hf1qdb0 comment I  bought 3 oz of Canadian maple leafs  coins with some unexpected money  so I did wrong ? No- no - no
I have some Bitcoin also 
Why not enjoy both my precious 
hf1phb0 comment I‚Äôd keep a little gold silver in case the internet goes down.  You could be saying the opposite in a real crisis.  All of it is a little much imo‚Ä¶have to diversify. 
hf1smwx comment >...because the price is ridiculously high...

Oh my sweet child ! We haven't seen ridiculously high prices yet. These are not even high prices. 

There is only 21 million coins of the hardest money the world has every seen. This is actually cheap 
hf1tjr1 comment Now you made 17% take it out and buy back the gold. Wait 10 years and be disappointed again.

Rinse.

Repeat. 
hf238rv comment Mmm hope not all of your gold. Precious metals are still valuable for if shit hits the fan in society, especially if the government becomes totalitarian or there is a massive war. Physical gold and silver still has its place. Btw, i love Btc, but i am also realistic. Won't be doing anything with Btc if there is an EMP that takes out your grid.  That being said, with the future gains you get you can turn around and buy even more gold than you converted and still have plenty of Btc. 
pzkv7c submission Pruning Node and lite nodes 
hf1hw2j comment yeh pruned will delete data over GB limit you set.

never heard of lite node.

downside is you can't provide historical data to any new nodes.

miners just need hash of last block. just in case maybe they'd keep a full last days worth of block hashes. 
hf1kq83 comment > If I‚Äôm not mistaken, a pruning node keeps the history up to a certain point or stores a certain amount of data.

Pruning keeps all UTXOs and only the latest few spent-TXOs (STXO?).  All you "need" is the UTXO set, but if you want to see TXN history you want both UTXOs and STXOs.

> What is the downside, if any?

You can't retrieve spent outputs.

> Do miners have to be full nodes?

No, but if you run a mining pool are you really gonna skimp on storage.  The risk is if an extremely rare, massive, reorg takes place.  You may have the last 10, 20, 30 blocks but if you have a 40 block reorg (only happened once) then you may not have enough history to reorg. 
hf1i23r comment Is Pruning node the correct term?

Okay about miners, that makes sense. 
hf1l2c1 comment Oh ok, so they actually keep a record of every UTXO. Now that I can understand. 

Thank you. 
hf1ihop comment pruned node. it's not the best term but whatever. it comes from pruning trees which is like cutting off dead branches and such. it sorta fits, in terms of what happens to the data on disk, but not great. 
hf1isoa comment It is taking certain parts of a Merkle tree. You‚Äôve never heard it referred to as a lite or light node? 
hf1k6af comment Maybe it's this. https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Lightweight_node

Seems a bit of a stretch to call it a node. I have a pruned node limited to 10gb or 5gb i forget. 
hf1kej7 comment I agree. They don‚Äôt actually validate any rules, seems wrong calling them nodes. Thank you for your help.

pzl4lp submission Strike app 
hf1k4vj comment has nothing to do with the app. it has to do with the arbitrary decisions of the people running your custodial 3rd party service and business. 
hf1mxof comment I use strike and buy and transfer BTC in small amounts it‚Äôs relatively fast but it‚Äôs best used with lightning invoices. Those lightning transfers are instantaneous and you don‚Äôt have to have BTC just cash in the account. 
hf1onca comment I deposit $100 from my bank debit card to the Strike app. I then pay $100 worth to a/my Bitcoin on chain address. The fee varies from 2 cents to 23 cents so far and can take from a few minutes to a few hours for confirmation. I can and do that as often as I like (DCA) up to my limit (currently set at $1000.)

On occasion, I deposit $101 and still pay my Bitcoin address $100. The $1 difference is enough to cover the fees for several transactions. 

You can also pay your own or someone else‚Äôs lightning invoice the same way with much lower fees. 

Of course, if you‚Äôre rich like everyone else on Reddit, Strike is probably not for you. 
hf28xsz comment Most exchanges have a 5-10 day holding period on ACH deposits. Not Strike...... It let me attach a checking account, deposit money and send it as btc to my cold wallet. No waiting period. 
hf1kfe6 comment My guess it's full kyc with harsh limits. So like $100 a day? $500? Not really useful for someone who wants to buy 10k or 50K worth of btc. 
hf20mur comment They only gave me a$25 deposit limit . I emailed them twice and got no response 
hf1kf82 comment But can you do it though? 
hf2x55f comment Interesting. I have never been charged a fee using Strike app to transfer out BTC on-chain. Which surprised me the first time. I just assumed Strike was willing to eat the Bitcoin network fees themselves because of the purchase price spread.

The only difference between me and you is I've purchased and transferred out more at a time (as much as the limit which is the same as yours). Maybe that's significant... 
hf3a02v comment This for me as well. Fast bank deposits, instant purchase power, quickly sent to cold storage. 
hf1u5zs comment Heaven forbid someone  have to buy 25k at a time. Pretty epic for the rest of us. You could look into it before saying it isn't useful on a guess.

pzlhoo submission total newbie 
hf1o4vx comment Read The Bitcoin Standard. And stop using robinhood. With robinhood you are basically accepting an iou as you don't hold the keys to the coin, hence you can't transfer it out of robinhood. You're forced to sell only. Use coinbase pro and place limit buys. And research dollar cost averaging, dca, which is essentially what you were saying, buying a little at a time. Just do it in an organized manner such as buying the same amount every week on Sunday. gl. Don't invest more than you're comfortable losing. Have fun and welcome to the party! 
hf1oyan comment Here‚Äôs my favorite resources.

Hearing multiple different experts views through the eyes of many podcasters seems to be a good way to develop understanding.  Some podcasts have things that others miss because of their perspectives.

Books: The Bitcoin Standard(great intro book), Layered Money, The Internet of Money(great intro book), Debt the First 5000 Years, Inventing Bitcoin, 21 lessons What Ive learned from Bitcoin, The price of Tomorrow, The Bullish Case For Bitcoin(great intro book) and The Blocksize Wars were good.

hf1uo6i comment yes every shitcoiner has this dream. and every ignorant noob must consider it at some point.  

maybe if you think real hard, you can come up with feasible manner in which this might happen; and then perhaps what bitcoin might be able to do to prevent it.  don't hurt yourself thinking though.  we have some of the world's best minds working on it.  there's a massive incentive to keep bitcoin working, since nobody wants to keep having to change systems and nobody wants their savings to become less valuable.  it's a common shitcoiner mentality to consider the simple technology of sound and censorship resistant money to be a more complex matter than it is.  bitcoin solved the problem already. it's done. social media will never be done, so comparing it to myspace is stupid.

pzmkt4 submission How to securely move mnemonic seed between countries? 
hf2cccm comment There have been several posts in the past regarding converting seed phrases into easily recited rhymes or simple songs. There was one about an Afghan refugee that had a seed phrase passed to him via a song from his father. Short of dementia or brain injury, this is rock solid. They could take absolutely everything and have you naked in a search and they still would be no closer to your keys.

The idea that you could have everything you own thrown in the trash, walk across an international border, and reactivate your wallet via a song with authorities none the wiser is fantastic. 
hf1vfky comment yes you need to worry. of course. they take people's cash and don't give it back. and that is the same thing as cash.  be very afraid.  i think you're dumb for doing it.  you should encrypt it. 
hf1uwhx comment Do not walk through the airport with your seeds on metal.  Can the plates be separated‚Ä¶ mail them separately.  

Or destroy the metal plates (dremel) and create laminated paper copies that are secure mailed. 
hf2b6i6 comment Personally, I would transfer them onto paper somehow then destroy the plates.  Or move the bitcoin to get a new seed.  

Once on paper i would make a simple cipher that scrambles letters.  Then get a small book that fits in your pocket, maybe a bible.  

Then mark letters in the bible to spell out your seed words.  Can even throw in a bunch false words and clues to throw people off.  Just as long as you know which ones are the real ones.

Keep the bible in one of those pick pocket proof travel belts.  Dont keep the cipher with the bible.  The cipher isnt as big of a deal as youd probably be able to reconstruct it from memory.  So maybe just put it in carry on.

Finally, if all of your bitcoin is on that one account, consider temporarily putting a large percentage of it on an exchange that works in both countries.  Then move it back when you arrive.

hf2nzo8 comment Use gpg to encrypt them and them to yourself in an obscure mail server such as protonmail. 
hf1v7up comment If you mailed them you'd make a backup right? you wouldn't risk package being permanently lost. So destroy the plates, and just take that backup with you. It's not that hard to hide a few words. Saving seed words in clear text is dumb. Especially on overpriced metal plates. 
hf1w5kp comment Order new metal plates and bring those with you, write your seed phrase on paper and keep it with you, destroy the old metal plates just before you leave, then when you arrive at where ever you're going just put your phrase back on the metal plates you bought.

hf279qj comment Yes, I felt the same way when I was still new to bitcoin. But after I had been involved with bitcoin for awhile and I understood how bitcoin works, I no longer got anxious when waiting for my transactions to get included in blocks. 
hf2ju2w comment Why is it stressful? Are you worried you used a wrong address or moving sums larger than your annual salary?

Elaborate, please. We might be able to help or introduce some tool.

I'm honestly more stressed when dealing with banks than my Bitcoin transactions. Bitcoin always deliver, banks sometimes stop it and start asking strange questions.

pznu35 submission 4 reasons to only buy and sell your bitcoins using p2p methods. 
hf268dj comment Maybe this applies to some people but for my purposes I dont see the appeal.

1. Im not a criminal so I'm not that concerned with full anonymity. If I could go back in time and do everything p2p then maybe this would apply but now the gov probably already knows all my wallets from my past activities so theres no point . Also how do I know the p2p guy wont deanomymize me?
2. I pay my taxes and have no intention of evading taxes.
3. I dont actually keep the coins on the exchange 24/7. Only when withdrawing. So the exchange risk only exists for the 1 hour during sale/withdrawal. During this hour Im not that concerned about the regulated multi billion dollar company losing my coins. Im much more concerned about the p2p guy robbing me.
4. See #3. My coins are actually in cold storage up in until Ive decided to transfer and sell. Ive actually made it a pain in the ass to get these coins out of cold storage. Before then, there is not a tempting sell button. 
hf25uko comment why why why 
hf2aog7 comment With nobody selling, it would be a very long, hard road to get enough to pay for the Mercedes E-Class Hybrid Electric, not to mention the seaside condo.

Two offers in my country / currency. The BIG offer is to buy 0.03... Around $1500. Whoop-dee-doo. Only need to do that 50X and hide the cash under the mattress in the meantime. I think a few eyebrows would be raised at me bringing in a suitcase with that much cash in it.

If I could find somebody that liquid with 6 figures US$, at the meeting, each of our gang of thugs would have weapons drawn to ensure nobody's going to try to pull a fast one. And THEN you'd have to check all that cash for counterfeits before sealing the deal!

Oops! The buyer wasn't some Mafioso! He was FBI! It's a sting operation!

Way too much stress for me. 
hf37rzo comment Where do you find these p2p opportunities? Craigslist? I wish I knew someone selling p2p for cash. 
hf3v9mh comment Evading taxes is a great way for the government to crack down on Bitcoin. Don't ruin it for everyone else! 
hf2bzwk comment Only real concern people should have if more countries would start banning bitcoin like China does, and then going after their crypto. But thats only a threat to a few countries right now.

Even tough I would like me some anonymous btc, my bigger concern is all of the bad stories from p2p exchanges where people got screwed over. 
hf4awjp comment Every one of your points is perfectly valid. However possibly someday you may regret letting too many people know about your BTC holdings. Crypto exchange staff members, IRS staff members, Bank staff members. The friggan whole world if any of those entities gets hacked.. No p2p works fine and it is fully 100% legal and open to people who value their privacy  above any other consideration. 
hf47jup comment Place an add to buy. Then you will get a better rate and more offers. Works for me.

hf28w7o comment It better have. Efficiency for everything has improved since 2016. 
hf3ak1n comment Yay good 
hf2qmko comment this does not matter. The relevant metric for Bitcoin is not hashrate, but actually used energy 
hf6dno8 comment Both are relevant, but yeah considering there's the difficulty adjustment and essentially fixed BTC mining reward schedule, total energy used is more important 
hf6xmti comment The efficiency in which miners turn energy into hashrate is important for the miners, as the relative performance indicates their profitability. The share of their hashrate gives the share of the mining earnings.

but for Bitcoin as a whole it does not matter if for 1GW the best hardware generates 1 hash/s or 1T hash/s. it's just important that the best hardware is used.

Apart of that, don't forget lightning network and its capability to process tens of thousands of transactions per second. 
pzohpj submission A man always has two reasons for doing anything 
hf29xm6 comment Instructions unclear. Bought more bitcoin 
pzoosq submission Why not allow miners to decide on the size of the block? 
hf2bcu0 comment There is no scalability problem with the Lightning Network, however to answer your question:

Increasing the block size will make the cost of running a node, the principal unit of self-sovereignty, more costly and therefore will drive the network toward centralization. 
hf2iokr comment >It would make transactions cheaper for users (no need to include transaction fee)

How would we prevent spam attacks. Let's say someone sending 1 satoshi to themselves, 1,000,000 times per minute?
How would we determine what's a spam transaction and what isn't? Would we end up censoring transactions?

**There's no free lunch.** Fees are good. To protect the network and keep the number of miners increasing. Instead of the opposite. BSV tried and failed. They lost most of their miners and recently have been badly attacked. Again! Many exchanges delisted the coin due to the attacks and the ones keeping the coin listed are asking for 1,000 confirmations - that's about one week of waiting. 
hf2l5zv comment I believe Bitcoin SV works this way. The fork that literally no one uses. 

Longer answer: the bigger the blocks the more data a node operator has to store locally. Storage gets expensive for your average Joe when we start talking about petabytes worth of data. The idea is that anyone and everyone in any country can afford to run a full node to decentralize the network. If you do what you are talking about malicious actors or miners could spam cheap transactions to bloat the blocks to a massive size forcing those that can't keep up off the network. This is literally why there was a blocksize cap put in place to begin with. 

TLDR: bigger blocks = centralization, smaller = best decentralization.

hf2gh56 comment Why would be size increase though?

It's the same number of transactions, same \~10 minutes to find the hash. 
hf2v8uf comment > I believe Bitcoin SV works this way. The fork that literally no one uses. 

That's because it doesn't "work" that way. People use your chain for cheap permanent cloud storage, we've seen this happen for every single chain with large blocks, it's a failed way to scale up when used as a primary measure. 

As most network, a layered approach to scaling up is better. The advantage of Bitcoin is that if there's a majority will to then increase the capacity on the first layer at any point (e.g. if technology permits it without excluding people from running nodes affordably), all the layers above see the benefits my many folds. 
hf2hsrg comment 
>Why would be size increase though?

It's the same number of transactions, same \~10 minutes to find the hash.

Then there's no need to increase the block size at all.

BUT if there's more transactions per block, let's say double of the number that fits into one block right now, the size of block would be double too. Having double the size of blocks in the chain, every node would eventually have to double the space to store the blockchain as well as the bandwidth of the internet connection. This costs more money and would discourage people to buy and run nodes, making the network more centralised.

hf2qsdq comment Woah! This escalated quickly!

Please always follow u/kbxads advice whenever signing up to any site. 
hf2knxw comment Hey, thanks for signing up. This is just an alpha test and part of the reason for it is to educate people about the risks of scams - without risking any real money.

The other people signed up are mostly my friends and the reason you can't trade any coins yet is because we haven't done the airdrop of $1m SFL USD yet.

The test will start when we have 50 players and will run for a week, with the winner being whoever has the most on Friday 8th at 18:00.

Sorry this wasn't clearer, it's a quick and dirty test and I didn't know if I'd get any takers apart from mates.

The form is https and passwords are not stored in the clear. You don't have to use a real email address if you don't want to because there is no verification (yet). You can see from my profile that I've been around this sub for a while and have no intention of scamming anyone!

**The things I like about BottlePay are:**

-	Quick easy to use UI
-	Lightning Integration
-	The easiest way to DCA 
-	Withdrawal fees can be as low as 1 sat/byte 

**The things I don‚Äôt like**:

-	1% transaction fee is a bit high.. (when Strike launch in the UK this quarter,  BottlePay will have to adapt). 

-	Cannot send funds to Muun Wallet, this is being fixed according to their roadmap

What I‚Äôve done is set up a weekly standing order from bank to BottlePay, then in BottlePay changed the payment route so when GBP goes into the account it auto converts to BTC, after a month or so I‚Äôll wait for a quiet mempool then send to cold storage.

pztfk5 submission Solar Flares 
hf34sxc comment Probably won‚Äôt have to pay bills at least. 
hf392ng comment Bla bla the economy crashes bla bla no more money bla bla no me internet bla bla no more porn...

What the fuck... no more porn ?!??! 

Fuck you flare 
hf38mob comment Everyone in major cities dies horribly and the rural back-to-the-land folks inherit all the Bitcoin. 
hf34v6a comment Bitcoin, similar to "the internet", is not a monolithic thing or something with a central server, or any other type of central point of failure. There is nothing that you can point to particularly and say "this is bitcoin". So to answer your question it is first important to define what you actually mean by "bitcoin", how severe the solar flare impact is, where it is focused, and many 2nd order disruption effects of that flare on the internet and other critical infrastructure.  

Most likely, bitcoin will be fine. It is very resilient and can be  fully "restored" as long as there are some copies of the historic UTXO dataset remain somewhere in the world. 
hf36js1 comment Bitcoin is just math and a ledger.

All the public addresses and private keys would still be fine, as that's just math.

And if there's at least one copy of the ledger alive, then all could be restored with any kind of primitive computer technology. 
hf3cdu1 comment What happens to Bitcoin when skynet becomes self aware? 
hf34gn9 comment The Internet will be knocked out, so no bitcoin.

On the plus side, you won't have to worry too much as we will all starve to death but not before seeing all the nuclear reactors around the world meltdown :) 
hf3a0rj comment This can‚Äôt happen.. the ‚Äòsuns‚Äô not what you think it is, or where it is‚Ä¶ 
hf3d1ro comment Nothing would happen.  This is a bunch of nonsense being propagated by fools.  

Today, there are many observatories, on Earth and in space, watching the sun. Any significant flare would be ***seen*** many hours before it could possibly reach earth.  Precautionary measures would be taken.

pzti2c submission What is the value of a blockchain outside of an application for money? (Bitcoin, not Blockchain by Parker Lewis) 
hf35k91 comment A "blockchain" is merely a chain of blocks, very literally. There is nothing inherently secure, efficient, decentralized, "distributed" or otherwise magical in a chain of blocks linked by hashes.  

What makes a blockchain secure, decentralized, permissionless and uncensorable is proof of work, economical incentives for miners to secure it, cryptography, developers and users who use their own nodes.   

So creating a blockchain or "putting it on a blockchain" doesn't automatically makes something secure. There need to be a few other components that make it so (see above). Who runs the server of a "decentralized" social media platform? How do you know that you actually own an NFT without trusting any specific site (or a bunch of sites or other third parties)?  

Of course, censorship resistancy is a desirable feature in many cases, but it also comes with heavy trade offs (being expensive or slow etc), so most of that stuff pretending to be decentralized is a DINO: Decentralized In Name Only.   

Decentralization is hard and expensive, that's why it makes sense only if people are willing to pay that price (and I doubt that the majority of NFT holders or Twitter users care about that; they care about easy UX, "number go up" and stuff like that). 
hf35k7u comment The incentives that make bitcoin secure rely on miners being paid in the asset for which they are providing security. This is why e.g. 'gold backed' blockchains are a sham - the asset doing the economic underpinning has to be *native* to the blockchain, or the incentives don't line up.

It is possible to build some things 'on top' of this secure layer, borrowing soundness from it to a certain degree, e.g. timestamping. NFTs may be another such application, but in this sense I'd mean vouchers/tickets/etc.

Art-based NFTs are absurd almost in the reverse of the way gold-backed blockchains are. The latter pretends the computer system can somehow reach into the physical realm. The former pretends blockchains can make digital files scarce throughout the digital realm, not just within the context of that blockchain system. 
hf35ljs comment There are "nfts" on the btc blockchain, they just aren'tas popular. Without bitcoin protocol the blockchain is just an extremely slow database. 
hf36bhf comment > Does a blockchain not make sense and work in the context of NFTs?

That's digital scarcity 
hf3zeb7 comment you mean outside of the largest and most important system in the world? oh, not much.  

this might help:  https://youtu.be/H_kyYrbBY1I 
hf60svv comment For use that's actually material and significant - it would only be valued for the most honest, antifragile secure form of money, Bitcoin.

Any other uses are immaterial or are for scams/gambling. Otherwise why else would you need to make things inefficient and slow down data in this world via a real slow database? 
hf3jc80 comment Literally everything. 

Crypto is automation and decentralization (depending on execution).

It can nearly replace anything we do better, faster, more efficient z and more securely. 
hf37tq7 comment This helps a lot. Lewis' comment that Bitcoin is a closed system that has no knowledge to the outside world comes to mind here. 
hf5a4dz comment Depending on your definition there are NFTs on bitcoin blockchain. Or atleast in a sidechain of bitcoin called Liquid. 
hf8qqt6 comment interesting...I don't fully understand why he believes we need to increase the blocksize?

[...]

>To me it's not about 'making the most money'. Chances are many shitcoins will have a greater return than bitcoin (over some period of time). If you want to play the shitcoin casino, go right ahead. Have at it.

Any clue when we‚Äôll get this in the UK? 
hf5t9j0 comment Fantastic thank you for providing the info and the detail to give us all more insight into how this works 
hf7nk4q comment Cool but fuck twitter, censoring jokes isn't cool 
hf3opei comment No I didn‚Äôt, I can‚Äôt get Strike from the UK, not yet I guess, that‚Äôs why the tips cost an on chain fee and not free. I use a normal segwit address by Coinbase wallet, any wallet can generate one I think: Electrum, Brd wallet, etc. 
hf47cct comment Strike is needed for lightning, strike provide the service of generating the invoice since you need a always node to generate invoices.

pzujga submission A Loaf of Bread Used to Cost 1 BTC; Now It Costs 0.0001 BTC ... now try that with dollars (2-minute audio clip from Anthony Pompliano) 
hf3vzzu comment I think these types of comparisons are pretty trivial at this point even thou I do believe in bitcoin as a protection from inflation. Of course an asset that was born a few years ago with zero value would be sharply increasing its purchasing power against fiat currencies during its adoption phase. 

The concept is correct, but these types of analogies are without much merit and so called experts professing them as scripture is somewhat unsettling. 
hf4gsom comment I've debated putting my whole savings account into bitcoin for this reason, but I'm still attached to fiat for some things 
hf77434 comment This is my shower thought based on my overly simplified view of the world and bad math.

Let's say there is $250,000,000,000,000 dollars currently in the world and 21,000,000 btc. We just convert all the money into Bitcoin so 1btc = roughly $12,000,000. 

A loaf of bread costs roughly $1 currently therefore it should cost around 0.00000008 BTC.

Hoorah 
hf447vz comment I'm pretty sure a reasonable (!) inflation for currency is a good thing. If a loaf of bread used to cost $1 and now it'd cost only 1/100 of a cent, then you would have been stupid to ever buy a loaf of bread, or anything else for that matter. Inflation forces people to invest their money. 
hf58j33 comment Exactly they are frankly stupid and just make it look like he is trying to do a cheap pump. I frankly prefer a pump based on more solid arguments‚Ä¶ 
hf7yt5a comment Its the brain its from birth you want to be a millionnare before the flop lmao shit even the elite knows its coming lmao watch this shit play out 
hf4gien comment You can't eat bitcoin though. People would still have to buy food and other necessities, it would just incentivize them to be more careful with their spending. Something that is not good for a consumerist economy. 
hf4tfbe comment A loaf of bread used to cost about a cent, now it's several dollars. Inflation does force people to invest, thus driving up the cost of investments. Look at the price of real estate and the stock market. It punishes savers, simple folks who hoard cash under a mattress lose spending power over time.  Risk taking is encouraged and old fashioned saving for a rainy day is discouraged.  Bitcoin flips this on its head. The best thing you can do with Bitcoin is just sit on it.  We will see a whole generation of the most patient getting rewarded, instead of the most greedy and impulsive. Time will tell if this system is better for society or not. 
hf4hljt comment Im not sure I agree. You are thinking from the view of MMT. We would probably see this in the short term until a new equilibrium is reached. Once we reach equalibrium, things will go back to normal except people will no longer be taxed via inflation. Let me give you an example of this in the real world. Computers and cell phones become more efficient and cheaper every year. If you wait until next year, you can get a better computer cheaper. This doesn't stop people from purchasing them every year. I also don't think people will stop buying food no matter the future purchasing power of a currency. It may reduce frivolous spending and reduce waste. 
hf4i3nm comment Inflation is not a free lunch. The value has to come from somewhere. It artificially pumps spending at the cost of everyone except the one printing. Imagine you have a currency divided amongst 5 people except one can print 10% of the total supply every year. The purchasing power is being shifted from everyone else to the one printing money. It doesn't actually create any value.
