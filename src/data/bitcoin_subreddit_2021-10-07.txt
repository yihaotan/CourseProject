q2wt3z submission Bitcoin Is Breaking out but other tokens aren‚Äôt faring as well, a sign that Bitcoin may be pulling away from the pack. 
hfoaegd comment This is how it works. The king comes first. The rest will follow when btc will be going sideways 
hfod42m comment Andreas Antonopoulos has a great talk about why Bitcoin is uniquely advantaged in the cryptocurrency space.

He compared it to how in biology, if you introduce an invasive species into an ecosystem where it can thrive, it will reproduce and box out other species.

Even if you try to introduce a new species that is more efficient / faster / smarter, it can‚Äôt overtake the first one because the ecosystem has changed.

Likewise, you can try to build a better Bitcoin that is marginally better in every way, but the cryptocurrency space has already changed.

You are too late to get in. This train has left the station 
hfoarxw comment Too late for crazy gains, not too late for a good investment.

Also, remember that Bitcoin can go down 80% or so. 
hfobv2i comment bitcoin isn‚Äôt a get rich quick scheme it‚Äôs a don‚Äôt get poor slowly scheme.

this is because if you take self custody of bitcoin, no one can take it from you and no one can dilute the value of it by creating more of it.

if you don‚Äôt have bitcoin then you are trapped in a monetary system that constantly devalues the purchasing power of your currency, which causes the cost of everything to inflate and dilutes the value of your savings. 

just treat bitcoin as your new savings account that pays on average 100% interest. just put in what you can every paycheck and forget about it for at least 4 years.

hfo7a74 comment Yeah, taxes need to get paid in the end. That's just part of the game.

Some countries provide great incentives for holding at least one year, like 50% off in Australia, and 100% off in Germany for example. 
hfoed9h comment Buy in one country, cash out in another one.

How is the tax supposed to work? According to country one or country two?

In absence of clarity, in my opinion, you need to apply the lowest of both taxation rates.

Now wire the money back to country 1 again.

I think that I am probably just imitating here what Google, Facebook, Apple, *et alii* routinely do.

hfp88ok comment A 2013 brother sighting! These are rare

My first buy was at $350, my average got to $500 (counting the 2018 fork traded back to BTC), and I've never sold. Anything I buy now would be a drop in the bucket so I'm preserving that average price instead 
hfojfs7 comment Yep.  This.  The longer you‚Äôre in the easier it gets to HODL.  I got in mid 2017, rode a parabolic wave up and then down, bought more here and there during the long winter.  I check the price daily, but no thought of selling. 
hfoeb52 comment I think it also helps if you have your coins in your own wallet, and specially in a cold wallet.

It's simple to have a watch-only wallet where you can send money to, but it's a bit more difficult to spend, since you'll need to sign the transaction with the cold wallet.

It's completely different to say, just having your coins in an exchange. You're probably going to sell them faster that way. 
hfojgop comment Yep.  This.  The longer you‚Äôre in the easier it gets to HODL.  I got in mid 2017, rode a parabolic wave up and then down, bought more here and there during the long winter.  I check the price daily, but no thought of selling.

q2yhou submission How can a wash sale rule apply to Bitcoin? 
hfoz1x9 comment > What if someone pays you salary in Bitcoin within 30 day of a sale that is a loss? What if someone gives you Bitcoin for whatever reason in exchange for anything or gift? What if they send to your address and it is outside of your control.

All of these things can happen with stocks, too.  What if your granny dies and you inherit all of her Apple stock?  The rules are meant to apply to your own purchases, not to random extraneous events outside of your control.

In the case of being paid in Bitcoin, you report that as ordinary income anyway.  It's not a purchase, you got paid in it, and it's taxable. 
hfogpse comment I think this rule is mostly for traders of cryptos in general.

And I reckon this rule would need to have nuances to deal with the cases you mention. 
hfp7ios comment I disagree that a wash sale rule "stifles usage". The rule is only about *when* you can claim a capital loss (importantly: it doesn't invalidate that loss).

IMHO there's nothing about it that makes it inherently more suitable to stocks vs. currencies. IIUC the proposal would apply equally to foreign currencies as well; it's unsurprising that US tax law would treat USD differently.

That is of course separate from whether wash sale rule is a sensible rule at all. You get a weird loophole in capital gains taxes without it but that doesn't necessarily mean it's the right fix: maybe a different way of taxing capital gains would be better.

Finally I've never sold BTC at a loss so I don't really even care either way. 
hfoph78 comment Because number go up. Get rid of the number go up cult and wash sale will never happen. ;)

hfox5jx comment I tried making a SEPA payment to Relai via TransferWise and it didn't work. Contacted their service desk and they responded with:

"...can't process any payments to account ending in XXXX". "Unfortunately we can't give any extra information about this - this is because of how we're regulated and licensed in different regions. Sometimes these decisions are out of our control". 
hfpg0w6 comment Wise don't know you're buying Bitcoin if you're buying P2P and if you don't put "cryptocurrency", "bitcoin" or similar in the payment reference  

It's almost impossible to use a Wise account to buy on a cryptocurrency exchange, or to send to PayPal. Sometimes the ban is at the other end - because virtual bank accounts are a fraud risk

Your friend has taken some college level Econ and is now dumber for it. We all took it, some were able to escape it.

The greatest transformation of the world took place during the industrial revolution. First in the UK. Then in the US. Both were on a hard money standard. Both saw soaring productivity. According to undergrad Econ, this is not possible.

Your friend would claim that without stable or slightly rising prices, entrepreneurs wouldn‚Äôt innovate. The idea is why would they innovate if prices are falling?

The idiocy is that prices don‚Äôt fall unless they innovate. Lower prices don‚Äôt just happen. They happen when someone goes from making a car one at a time to using an assembly line. They can make more money by selling larger volumes at lower prices. This does not require devaluing money.

Hopefully, that‚Äôs enough to get you started and maybe googling a few things.

q2z8ip submission Question about the value of the USD in relation to the Fed printing new money 
hfomupo comment The USD is dropping in value by means of "temporary" price increases and other "temporary" inflation, all of which will very soon, any time now, disappear again, because the Fed says so.

Don't be mistaken about the still relatively stable exchange rate with for example the Euro, because the ECB is also printing trillions of Euros, nicely in lockstep with the FED.

If the employers don't soon start paying out higher wages to their drones, they will perennially face "temporary" labor shortages. However, if they do, they will have to reprice their products upwards. Next, go back to step one. Lather, rince, repeat.

Is there any way to stop this cycle?

No, not without substantially increasing interest rates. Will they do that? No, because that would bankrupt half of the corporations, indebted consumers, and even half of the government itself.

So, they are now sitting between a rock and a hard plate. It will inevitably end in a so-called "hard landing". Where is the popcorn? 
hfomxc4 comment As far as I know they slowly inject all the dollars, they don't inject them all at once. 
hfp0hht comment because news doesn't change prices. more money chasing the same number of good makes people bid up the price of things.  it takes time. and there's lots of sticky prices in the economy which create a sort of inertia. for example mcdonalds doesn't want to go and jack up their prices every time the fed prints. and it also helps that big multinationals like mcdonalds actually benefit from fed money printing because they are holding lots of assets. so that helps mcdonalds be able to keep prices low, and extend their market domination. so in effect, the rich get the first benefit from the money printing, and they keep it while their pockets get fatter. but eventually that money makes it into the economy.    

for example, i wonder if you realize in your question that salaries and wages are a price just like a big mac is a price. so if both prices went up in sync, then would the effect essentially be nothing?   that's not how it works because price discovery is based on humans making voluntary transactions.  wages don't rise until people start demanding higher wages. and sometimes prices don't rise until the seller absolutely has to increase them. 
hfonssq comment It takes time for that money to enter the market. 
hfomr4f comment It depends on how you are measuring the value of the dollar. Are you measuring it against other currencies? Or do you value it based on purchasing power (market basket)? 

The dollar is losing value in terms of purchase power. (That‚Äôs how we measure inflation.) Your dollar won‚Äôt buy as much milk as it did a few years ago. 

The exchange rates for currencies are based on supply/demand like anything else. People still want the US Dollar. If they want it, they will ‚Äúbuy it‚Äù with other currencies (exchange) and the value will remain high. 

If you hold a bunch of foreign currency like JPY, just wait for the US government to do something stupid and ‚Äúbuy the dip.‚Äù I did this several times when Trump was in office. He had a gift at tanking the Dollar for a few days with a single tweet.

hfpikk3 comment Tax implications. You can hold a etf in your roth ira or 401k and pay zero taxes, when you buy for the longterm. If you hold spot BTC, you'll pay capital gains tax on those, when you sell.

My favorite thing is axing FUD because when someone eventually does bring up btc it's some bs they heard on the news. ESPECIALLY recently with the energy fud as I'm a student in electrical engineering. 
hfr2n3e comment My parents are reasonably well off landlords who got lucky on the land game, but they are also sort of ignorant of all the taxation as well as equity investments, which are more tax efficient. My point is most people who harp on about land are ignorant old boomers.

I don't understand who was investing, for 20 years but did not manage to beat inflation. An S&P 500 index tracker would have eviscerated inflation, so I don't get what a person, who, assuming they were smart enough to have a good job where they could have been investing from a young age, could have been stupid enough to have been doing where they did not make 3% a year. Fucking beanie babies? 
hft4ri0 comment Bring up Bitcoin once. If your audience dismisses what you have to say, don't bring it up again. Just keep stacking sats and enjoy your relationship with them. When they later see what bitcoin has done for your life, they'll be up your ass trying to learn more.

Everyone gets bitcoin at the price they deserve. 
hfpen7d comment My dad gave me 10k of his to invest, about 1.5 year ago... He hasn't been able to complain as at it's worst... it was still 1k up from what his initial amount was.

hfr8u99 comment My great grandparents never understood the appeal of television. My grand parents never understood the internet. My parents never understood smart phones.

Imagine if they can do that with Bitcoin they might as well be able to print and buy US Dollar or Gold. 
hfoyiyr comment Can you prove that it is? 
hfoyp7g comment proving the absence of something is notoriously difficult. since it implies complete knowledge in the given domain.  nobody has complete knowledge about who is doing what with bitcoin. and nobody should. 
hfp1fpm comment How do you know that there isn't a teapot orbiting Mars? 
hfozh27 comment US Dollar printing money. I'm not worry about Belarus 
hfpdcee comment This probably wont be happening bc there isn't a exchange/seller out there that accepts the belarusian ruble. If this happens at all its probably at a small scale and i bet that big trades wont be possible as liquidity would dry up almost instantly.

To entertain the thought it could be done in a roundabout way by buying usd/euro and converting to btc. Problem with this is that it would drain their foreign currency reserves which has a whole slew of problems attached to it. 
hfrjwwe comment Bitcoin can be purchased from someone who is selling it. Seller must want what you have to offer. 
hfp2ddo comment No way to know but it would impact the value of their currency. The person giving up the bitcoin would get Belarus currency. They would either spend it or exchange it for a different currency. Exchanging it for different currency devalues it directly. Excessive spending of Belarus currency would devalue it indirectly.. I think. 
hfp04kw comment Nope.  You can't.

You could end up doing very well. To me, feels too risky. I'd rather just stack sets weekly and hold over time.  Best wishes 
hfp3y9t comment No one knows what could happen, so I wouldn't have sold everything, because that means you've put all your bet on the market going down, which is just as risky, imo, as leaving everything in and thinking it's going to go up.

hfp44uw comment No but you can write it off on your taxes, if you did have to pay dear old Uncle Sam 
hfp5fs3 comment You'd need to check the rules for the country that you live in. Generally you'd have to sell your alts at a loss before they had any effect on your tax bill 
hfp7tpx comment It depends on the timing.  If u made a huge profit and sold in December.  Then jumped back in and lost all your money in January then u owe the taxes on the gain still 
hfpajbo comment This depends on your country of residence, among other things, as the laws are different in each place.

Generally speaking, trading crypto without considering tax implications [can be a bad idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/9tcnu8/did_i_ruin_my_life_by_trading_crypto/). 
hfrk1m2 comment You must report all trades between all coins to anything else. If there is a realized loss it can offset realized gains. 
hfp4kkf comment 3k max per year... 
hfp82tw comment > 3k max per year

That's a limit on how much *net* capital loss you can deduct from income each year.

There isn't a limit on claiming capital losses to offset capital gains. So if you make a bunch on bitcoin but then lose it all on altcoins, you'll net out to zero (or negative if you lose everything including the initial amount). Important caveat: that's within the same tax year. 
q327tl submission Will any of the big China-based bitcoin mining pools shut down soon? 
hfp44ts comment Where there is a will there is a way 
hfp59yg comment They'll be banning crypto again and closing one more pool everytime BTC gets near 60k. They're in a loop. 
hfp79ij comment A pool is just a server or six which receives stats from miners so that it can distribute payments fairly. It's likely that the China pools rent servers outside China because the data centers and Internet networks are better in Europe  

So they don't have to do much to move out of China. There's no fiat money. If any of the pool owners are corporations, they'll need to re-incorporate in Seychelles or Nevis or similar. If any of the operators or admins are identifiable people, they should adopt aliases  

Those who want to, and are able to, might emigrate

>It's using swaps, every time you send a LN transaction you're basically sending an on-chain transaction to the muun node and they settle the LN invoice for you, and vice-versa for receiving LN payments. Therefore every LN transaction you do means also one on-chain transaction, so this doesn't really help with scaling, which is LN primary focus.

>I really would have no idea about this as well if it weren't for one transaction that had the little triangle warning with the "this transactions requires an on-chain confirmation so it will take longer" text, and it made no sense to me that a LN transaction would need an on-chain confirmation when the source funds were also deposited through LN... so I went digging through their source code, found they're using [submarine swaps](https://wiki.ion.radar.tech/tech/research/submarine-swap) and now it all makes sense. After I knew what to google for it wasn't very difficult to find them [confirming my suspicions](https://twitter.com/MuunWallet/status/1432553439423258625).

hfp7u6i comment Yes I think !lntip works. 
hk8cdvf comment Nice!! It works! 
hfpa5j3 comment Some cool things related to lightning that might be relevant:

- [Lightning Address](https://lightningaddress.com). This allows you to pay and receive payments using any digital username, like an email, or a telegram username, etc.

- [LNPay](https://lnpay.co/). This allows you to setup paywalls and faucets with lightning. They use the latest stuff like lnurl so that you can transfer money with just one click (with supported wallets).

- [Muun wallet](https://muun.com/). This wallet is extremely simple to use and allows you to receive a few sats with zero initial funding. They open all the channels for you automatically. Ideal for the bitcoin beginner.

hfpv39g comment !lntip 500 

so easy.

Yes it's custodial but you can withdraw/deposit immediately.

Actually, for tipping, it's non-custodial. You just pay the invoice generated.

For holding until withdrawing your tips, obviously it's custodial. 
hfq82gb comment I have to ask. Why do you care about custodial risk for $135 worth of assets. 
hfp81yl comment Thanks. I may resort to that. But it's custodial, right? And what about Twitter and other platforms 
hfpbdzb comment > Muun wallet. This wallet is extremely simple to use and allows you to receive a few sats with zero initial funding. Ideal for the bitcoin beginner.

I think this suggestion should probably be changed with something that does not use one on-chain transaction with *every single* LN transaction.

> They open all the channels for you automatically.

They don't actually open *any* channels.

[Phoenix wallet](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) would be a good alternative. 
hfpg9jx comment It's partly that, yes. There are a million and one ways to transfer IOUs to each other and I don't want to support any of these wolves in sheep's clothing muscling in.

I know the use case is pocket change so it doesn't matter so much if the custodian does something bad or stupid, but still, what I am interested in is people getting comfortable with handling their own keys, their own coins, their own channels.

I know it's not easy but I think it's possible.

hfpebxt comment To be completely fair, 6000 out of 68 million is a low percentage, and even so, they reimbursed all stolen funds. 
hfq42ks comment My opinion is same, Big exchange security similar to bank, only with latest technical problem solving solutions. Other hand is regulations.

Truth is most of participants, are no, ready to secure digital currency, so let it do professionals.

More likely you will get your coins back, to get back from your own wallet, if hacked. 

Internet network is enough secure, if you are enough ready to can keep cryptocurrency safe.

Start and learn technical aspects. To be ready for that revolutionary technology.

ICO, De-Fi, DAO, your own coin.

Or save it in famous crypto-banks (including exchangers), just learn word ‚ÄúRegulated‚Äù by country and organization. 

Crypto is in the future you live right now.

hfpel1b comment tldr; Crypto exchange Coinbase disclosed that a threat actor stole cryptocurrency from 6,000 customers after using a vulnerability to bypass the company's SMS multi-factor authentication security feature. To conduct the attack, the attackers needed to know the customer's email address, password, and phone number associated with their account and have access to the victim's email account.

And I bet 99.9% of those people are less wealthy as a result.

People are constantly talking about strategies of selling half at $x and letting the rest ride or selling their initial investment and play with ‚Äúhouse money‚Äù.  

The truth is, the best strategy is to simply buy it and not sell any, ever. Sure, enjoy your life etc, but realise the true cost of what it is you‚Äôre spending your Bitcoin on.

hfqheqh comment Where do you think all that yield is coming from? Someone is risking your money in ways you're not aware of and possibly not privy to. I'm not defending banks here, but as others have said, its way less risky to keep your money in a bank. IMO its also comprably way less risky to just keep it in bitcoin. You know its gonna go up. Bitcoin has had an appreciation rate of about 65%/year. You get that without risking anything - just hodl. Adding an additional 20% return by multiplying your risk by 1000 doesn't really seem like a good deal to me.
