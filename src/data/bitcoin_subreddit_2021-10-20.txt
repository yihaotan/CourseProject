qbp228 submission US Treasury: Digital assets could hamper US sanctions effectiveness 
hhb2yqk comment > Digital assets could hamper US sanctions effectiveness

Yes.  That's one of the nice things about Bitcoin.  No more using the global reserve currency as a weapon.  No more punishing poor people half-way around the globe because our oligarchy doesn't like their oligarchy. 
hhb755s comment > to make it more difficult to convert it to government-issued money

First of all: which one of the 200+ government-issued monies is it about?

If they manage to make BTC-->USD hard, then the route BTC-->KRW-->USD would still be open.

So, that means that they need to put pressure on the Koreans to shut down BTC-->KRW by threatening to otherwise shut down the next leg, i.e. KRW-->USD.

Hence, they would have to bully 200+ other governments into doing what they want, or else!

Even amidst a kaka phonic flurry of incessant bullying, I cannot see how they will eventually manage to prevent leaks from occuring across all possible BTC-->XXX-->USD indirect conversion routes.

Secondly, it will cause an increasing volume of crypto simply not to get converted.

"Hey, here is 25,000 USDT. Figure out by yourself how to turn that into USD.", "Ok. No prob. I will leave it to the next guy to figure that out. If he wants my money, he'll also have to take USDT."

Some people will specialize in conversion to fiat but most users will for reasons of convenience just circulate the crypto. It will certainly not prevent the user population from growing. Fiat will increasingly become associated with hassle and obnoxious bureaucratic ceremonies, until people no longer even want it.

hhb5fpr comment The fomo begins 
hhf3pd1 comment WRITE THIS DOWN AND DO EXACTLY AS I SAY!!!


Open a Capital One Venture card.  Send money to your wife/best friend via Paypal.  deposit it directly into your checking account and buy BTC.

Take it 10 steps further open other cards all 0% for 18 months do a balance transfer from your Capital One Venture to the new card and repeat (however many times you can).

If BTC goes up 1% in 18 months you will be up money....I asked the same questions months ago.  EVERYONE, thought I was an idiot.  I paid off all my cards now own (BITCOINS) for free and all my cards are paid off...trust your gut!!!  BTC is going to double by the end of the year (not financial advice). 

I was hated by so many people in this community but it all paid off.

hhb899j comment Look up and learn about the "Cantillon effect".  

Inflation is a symptom of a shifting of wealth -- the "money printing" that causes inflation is a form of theft. 
hhba8id comment Inflation is just forced taxation without a vote. It’s absolutely a shift of wealth because it actually benefits those who get the money first before it’s inflated. The government and banks. Meanwhile the people down the road get stuck with a printed dollar worth less than it was before it trickled down to them. 
hhbay2c comment Until wages get inflated and you make $30 an hour for working at McDonald's. Wage inflation hurts everyone just like regular inflation. It's all connected. 
hhbcqvn comment Who cares if your making $30 an hour if wages raise *in response* to costs. The costs are already up. Now you’re in a perpetual game of catch up. But you correctly state it’s all connected. And it’s all an illegal taxation and theft by colluding central banks, big banks, and government. None of it benefits anyone except the people who get the money first. The wages go higher argument is an argument for trickle down economics. Which is proven to be a failure. The only truly equal fiscal policy is a policy based on sound money and not a fiat currency system. Because a fiat system can never be deflationary. It’s not how it was built to work. And it’s inherently inflationary.

hhb8v9h comment You are not late. 
hhb9bfx comment so what if you missed the train to instant wealth? even if that were true (it's not), bitcoin would still be better than dollars or bubble stocks or negative yielding bonds or gold. 
hhc3c4w comment Its been growing on average at 200% per year for a decade.

Lets cut that in half because we’re being conservative cause this is your money and we aren’t gamblers.

You have three options in front of you for this money.

1) dollar cost average into Bitcoin and grow at 100% per year

2) put it into an alt coin and hope you beat 100% per year.

3) put it into the stock market and hope to get 15% per year.

In my opinion, if you believe 100% returns are too slow for you then you need to re-examine your priorities because they may be incorrect.

If you only want to invest in crypto to become rich quick and you find yourself looking at meme coins to “catch up” or “get in early” you may have a budding gambling addiction and you should probably just buy an index fund.

Bitcoin currently presents the greatest risk to reward dislocation in the entire market, and its not even close.

It will crush stocks and its only slightly riskier than them, it will trail alts but its **much** safer than them.

Bitcoin is the sweet spot, buy a little each month, if you find yourself losing sleep because you’re worried you’ll lose it all, sell a little and sit it out for a few months.

Do not take on leverage.
Be patient and trust your research.
If you don’t trust your research don’t fucking buy it and do more research!

Good luck!

qbrkkh submission Why do I need to run my own node to "truly verify" transactions? 
hhbh278 comment If you're not running your own fully validating bitcoin node, then you are using a lightweight wallet that is connecting to other people's servers. You're relying on other people's full nodes. You don't know that the information is true and accurate. If you want to truly verify transactions and know that everything is accurate, you have to run your own full node. 
hhfz7dp comment You can run an Umbrel full node on Tor so now it’s effectively anonymous. Move your coin from the exchange to your node, then node to your hardware wallet. 
hhbhjqk comment You can do that. That's fine. Check a few blockchain explorers. Done. 
hhbhn48 comment Accourding to Lukedashjr's crawler there are [about 57k fullnodes](http://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/software.html).

That compares to 56+ million users on Coinbase, Millions using Trezor/Ledger/BB02, and millions more using software wallets like Samourai/Blue/phoenix/bread/etc

If you're not connecting to your own node, you are trusting Coinbase's or Ledger's node (etc) to confirm your transactions, how do you know you really have Bitcoin, or  that they haven't formed an evil alliance to push a non-consensus bitcoin fork.

Furthermore [Chainalysis have confirmed what many have suspected they they do run listening nodes, a public blockexplorer and Electrum Servers in order to de-anonymise bitcoin users.](https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1440371592081543177) 
hhbhzxm comment But in practice, how would someone take advantage of me? 

If you send me 1 BTC and after checking several blockchain explorers, as well as my wallet, it says the transaction is confirmed, how can that not be true? 
hhbhsm5 comment [deleted] 
hhbiywd comment The information from the blockchain explorers and electrum servers could be inaccurate. I never said that this is likely to happen but it is possible. You keep saying wallet but not all wallets are the same. You are specifically talking about lightweight wallets and you're talking about relying on other people's full nodes. If you the wallet you checked is bitcoin core, then you know the information is accurate because you are running your own full node. If you connect your electrum wallet to your own electrum personal server, then you know the information is accurate because you are running your own full node.

If bitcoin is digital gold, then your full node is your own personal goldsmith that verifies that the incoming gold is real. 
hhbiax2 comment This is the case. Anybody can run a full node and verify everything on their own. This makes the bitcoin network reliable. You don't understand bitcoin yet. 
hhchfg9 comment >the network

You mean the bitcoin network? The one comprised of bitcoin nodes? 
hhbomr6 comment Thank you, that makes sense. I guess I just find it unlikely that my lightweight wallet is showing me info from a compromised or inaccurate node. 

Never found that need to run my own node, but I'll look into it.

hhbs4xj comment I dunno man. That shit just made me wanna buy more bitcoin 
hhbwl5y comment Looking forward to trading fiat for BTC @$100k 
hhbuqsm comment Here's a better answer than the one you just gave, but with data:

[https://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-risk-adjusted-return/](https://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-risk-adjusted-return/)  (This assumes you are comparing it to other major assets, for the purpose of looking evaluating likeliest returns and best asset(s), using a Sharpe Ratio.)

Edit:  For the past few years, I've had a lot of people ask "what will bitcoin(s) be worth in...?" with questions asking about worth at some future date.  Here is how I like to answer that:

\- Rather than answer from the perspective of worth based on comparison of one asset to another, I would rather we measure the worth of Bitcoin based on what it can do and how it is unique.

\- Bitcoin should not be measured based on “value in USD” or similar fiat measurements. We should say that Bitcoin as a protocol is valuable and bitcoin (with a little b) as a currency is also valuable, but the popular inclination to measure bitcoin (currency) only in relation to USD or other fiat value is not a correct way to estimate value.

\- Let us say then that the value of Bitcoin is equivalent to new usage (both new users and innovation leading to new uses of Bitcoin) and that increases in adoption of bitcoin and other cryptocurrency shall also provide an indicator of value, independent of comparisons to fiat.

hhbid59 comment By paying rats to narc on farms then confiscating everything and selling the equipment 
hhbifqi comment You just need to write and pass a law to ban bitcoin. Ban is just saying you can't use it. Actually stopping people from using it is a completely different thing. 
hhbumgz comment 1. Make a law stating that Miners can't use the "Peoples socialized electricity grid"
2. Identify miners that have already filed for state licenses to run a business.
3. Show up at the site and tell them "give me the miners or you go to jail"
4. Collect ASIC miners, rinse and repeat.

There are miners that never filed for a license from the state to operate.  If they are ever discovered they will be "handled" with great prejudice.

qbskyk submission Taking a Loan Against Bitcoin Vs Selling 
hhbo6ba comment If you think the market is going to go down then selling and rebuying cheaper is the move. Most people who think they can time the market cannot, however. The idea behind the loan strategy is that you think bitcoin will continue to appreciate and instead of losing your bitcoin and it's future gains by selling you are able to keep it and hopefully it will appreciate by enough to cover the interest and you come out ahead in the end. 
hhbomsn comment If you take out a loan with btc as collateral you don't get hit with cap gains tax. What is absolutely uncertain is whether there is going to be a bear market or not. No one can predict the future. If you don't need money don't borrow it. 
hhbp5y5 comment A loan is a loan.  Be careful. 
hhbq5uj comment When you sell it is a taxable event, you can lose a lot of money to the IRS, then from what is left you can spend on some and hopefully repurchase your position at a cheaper price later.  The loan is betting things won't crash below the level of collateral involved.  And will then go back up beyond what you now have 
hhc3arb comment it's not difficult to understand. a loan isn't taxable. the end.   

but of course if you don't pay the loan, then your bitcoin will be cashed in for you, and therefore will be taxed.  it's just a better approach, especially if you expect bitcoin's price to rise over time (no brainer).  you still have to pay it back though. but you're paying yourself (minus the interest of course).  the point is: if you need money in the short term, and you have equity, whether that's bitcoin or home equity, or any other equity you can loan against, it's better than selling your assets because of the tax consequences of selling your assets (and because you have to give up your assets which have value beyond just their monetary trade value).   

if you need the money and can't pay it back at all, then maybe a loan isn't the best idea.

qbt7ad submission Does Bitcoin work in commerce 
hhbsg4f comment for online commerce obviously it's fine since there's nobody waiting behind you in line.   

doublespending is essentially impossible, but i assume what you mean is resubmitting to the mempool before the first confirmation.  one the one hand, no merchant should be accepting mempool transaction requests as confirmed payments.  but yes that is an issue in the sense that merchants, especially brick and mortar merchants with lines of customers, should wait for at least 1 confirmation, probably 2. and that could take 1 minute or hours in some cases.    

that's why lightning network exists. it's a novel implementation of instant payment channels. look into it.  that's what they are using in el salvador, and elsewhere for payments.  

other payment solutions include corporate solutions like paypal who is implementing merchant payments with bitcoin balances through the traditional payment systems. other credit card and debit card solutions also exist for this.    

but as lightning network matures, and we see more corporate and open source options, the payments "issue" will be a thing of the past.  

it's already a fairly solved issue.  in other words, it's not holding bitcoin back really.  the real issue is the lack of demand for merchant payments with bitcoin. people are holding, and they don't want the accounting and tax requirements and consequences for merchant purchases.  this is the real obstacle, and i suspect it will start to be resolved with more countries acting like el salvador who treat bitcoin like a currency for tax purposes.  it will probably have to be a populist, sort of grass roots movement to pressure govts to do this. 
hhbyepm comment I’m not sure how exchanges handle bitcoin transactions but i think they operate differently.

Some exchanges use lightning. Some use the liquid sidechain. Others may use bitcoin itself or something else? 

This is why it’s best to self-custody after you purchase your bitcoin. Double spends are not a concern after 1 btc confirmation iirc on layer 1.

Most commerce should be done with lightning which is instant so you don’t need to wait. 
hhe50kj comment Bitcoin is a protocol. 
hhee6y5 comment > Coinbase Commerce/Bitpay

They're not important. Bitcoin is a person-to-person payment system. Customer sends Bitcoin to merchant's address. Merchants who use third-party parasites like BitPay are not real Bitcoin users  

Bitcoin does not allow double-spending. Where there are multiple unconfirmed transactions trying to spend the same coin, only one of them can be confirmed (mined in a block)  
https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-November/014843.html  

Most Bitcoin transactions are on-line purchases (the purpose described in the white paper). If a meatworld transaction is slow to confirm, the merchant can send a child-pays-for-parent transaction to accelerate transaction confirmation. Some restaurants are known to use CPFP if the customer's transaction is taking too long to onfirm 
hhcbweb comment Your comment/question doesn't make any sense....no double spend us possible with BTC unless (and only theoretical btw) you control 51% of all BTC hash power.

hhbrzy0 comment One is money, the other isn't 
hhbsyp2 comment LOL proof-of-shit is not secure against nation states or even large coroporate actors.  It's proof of nothing. It's fiat currency all over again. It's definitely not money. It cannot be the basis for an economy.    

The entire model is a tautology:  

Q: How does the network secure against double spends and other attacks?   

A: The miners put their tokens up to guarantee their honesty.  

Q: But why do the tokens have value in the first place?  

A: Because the miners put their token up to guarantee their honesty.  

Q: So if the token goes down in value, the network security goes down too? Causing a cascading effect? 

A: Yes, but moon!  

Vitalik (the CEO and commander of the ethereum state) often spoke about eth's inferiority to bitcoin in the past. But lately he's been more quiet about that i suspect because he sees the opportunity for all these ignorant noobs to make assumptions about eth and naturally compare it to bitcoin in energy usage terms.   Serious people who understand finance and economics and markets realize bitcoin is in another category altogether and cannot be replaced by proof of stake.  It has to do with bitcoin being less corruptible because it's tied to real world resources and supply chains, where as PoS has the same attack vectors as the fiat money system because it's just numbers on a screen. It doesn't mean it's good for nothing (although i would argue it is good for exactly that), but it does mean it's inferior as an incorruptible and hard base money.  

The kind of people who go for eth are the kind of people who see the fiat money system as perfectly fine, or don't really understand why people complain about central banks. These are entitled early adopter types chasing after the newest thing just because it's new and some smart guy seems to think it's the future.  These are not innovators and rebels trying to take down central banks and all their blood and tyranny with it. They're just riding the NASDAQ wave as far as they can, and eth is just an extension of that. Put another way, ETH is fintech. Bitcoin is money itself. 
hhbtqw6 comment 60 million ETH premine, no supply cap, no cap on blocksize, PoS. What else do you need to know? 

I hold ETH, but I would probably sell off a good chunk of my position if they switched to PoS. 
hhbsmt2 comment Make an ether transaction... bitcoin is more funtional than eth, and its not old, its constantly getting developed and leading the way. Lightning and taproot makes eth look like a scam shitcoin. 
hhbtwyz comment Proof of stake is far less decentralized because it allows ppl with lots of eth (whales) to make more eth more rapidly than ppl with less eth. So basically developers and massive corporations with lots of eth will control it’s production and benefit enormously if eth continues to be used. Proof of stake also stops the natural incentive to mine similar to literal mining and replaces it with a fiat style money printer that is controlled by the developers of eth (as far as I understand it)

Now eth is like fuel for the etherium network, but it becomes worthless/far less valuable if etherium is replaced by a better service platform.

Bitcoin is simply a decentralized digital currency with a limited supply and wide spread adoption and belief in its value. It resists hyperinflation and it’s value comes from itself and the community that mines it. 


Also for my last point etherium didn’t move to proof of stake to save the environment. This happened to make developers even richer. Also decentralized currency that depend on proof of work does use a lot of power but think about this. Much of the world depends on the US dollar. The US dollar is dependent on modern banking, the government + the military to keep the market/world in order. That creates a hell of a lot more pollution and emissions compared to proof of work mining. Also as societies begin to increase their use of nuclear, wind, solar, and hydropower mining will be much less damaging to the environment. 

For scale the mining of gold creates about twice as many emissions as Bitcoin mining. The US banking system produces about twice as many emissions as Bitcoin mining. And the emissions of Bitcoin mining will dramatically decrease once more green energy infrastructure is built and used.


Sorry for the rant but the battle for the soul of crypto is super interesting to me. Hope this was helpful.

qbta1i submission Bitcoin Revolution Website 
hhbs0y8 comment We have a lot of newcomers entering the Bitcoin space recently who are exploring different exchanges and such. Some users are developing a habit of asking if various random websites some complete stranger PM'd them is a scam or not. Sometimes these sites are completely unrelated to Bitcoin. This is not the purpose of r/Bitcoin.

* Do not trust unsolicited messages telling you to check out some shady website.
* Do not trust Discord randos telling you that you won a prize.
* Do not trust anyone who promises guaranteed profits.
* Do not trust website with unpronounceable domain names
* Do not trust anyone claiming to give away free Bitcoin. (YouTube, Twitter, Discord)
* Do not trust anyone claiming they will double however much Bitcoin you send them.
* Do not trust 'pretty girls' on Tinder telling you about new investment opportunities.
* **If you have to ask** if some sketchy website or special offer is a scam, **then it probably is.**

You have to learn to think for yourselves. Recognize that there are many tricksters out there who will go to great lengths to separate you from your Bitcoin. Use your head and stay safe. If you send your Bitcoin to a scammer, it's gone forever. There are no refunds!

hhd2mkd comment Not gonna lie, the past 3 months have been tough. Seeing it dip to 29k. Hodling through it. Stacking more. Liquidating shitty performing stocks and throwing it all into BTC. Knowing the fair value is 100k at least. If you held down to 29k and bought more, this one's for you baby. 
hhbw8lo comment This time is different than the 2017 Chicago CME top and coinbase ipo top no denying it. No sell the news event.

qbtqin submission Serious query: Why haven't these plants relocated to Paraguay? Electrical power, all hydro, is essentially free and endless. 
hhbwycb comment Maybe there is not sufficient governmental clarity? No incentive to bring miners in. Tax reasons? 

Governments should give incentives to attract these kind of industry....

If other give the right motivation, miners will move to them. 
hhc0eqq comment Paraguay is one of those countries that people just seem to forget about or misunderstand.  I know a guy who made a small fortune with cattle out there because the market is so stupidly undervalued. People will pay for the Argentinian and Uragayian product, but somehow omit that Paraguay had the same benefits and is a stable country.

You’ve just inspired me to reach out to him and talk Bitcoin mining. THANKS! 
hhc2jli comment how do you know they aren't working on it?  this mining movement, if you will, is just starting to catch on as an idea worth considering. and it takes close to a year to setup a mining operation, and longer if you have regulator hurdles, and legal questions, supply chain friction (/clearthroat).

hhcl1oe comment 
>Hello im new to cryptocurrency and posting on reddit, i have enough spare money to invest in 0.009 bitcoin should i? or should i look into investing in different cryptocurrency? what would u BitRedditors suggest? 

​0.009 Bitcoin is almost one million satoshis. Many users in this subreddit HODL less than that and are proud to be this early. Buying another coin is like playing a roulette at a casino. Many of them won't last a few years and will eventually end up at places like this: https://99bitcoins.com/deadcoins/ 

Take a look at my short guide:

Congrats on the move, it's never too late. ONLY INVEST MONEY YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE.

Price wise, nobody knows what the price will be tomorrow, nor next week. Statistically, it's less than four years from now. Anyone who bought Bitcoin at any point in the past and held it for 4+ years is in profit. 

**Try "Bitcoin ONLY" strategy for at least first year**, you'll sleep much better. Newcomers lose so much money, holding garbage tokens just because someone on YT told them to.

Going DCA is probably the best approach, IMHO. 
Bitcoin to me, is a savings account. If I have some spare cash, I exchange it for SATs. Once a week works best for me, but I'm getting paid weekly. If there's a 10% drop in the price since my last buy, I usually double my buy. This [DCA calculator](https://amber.app/calculate-your-investment/) might help to decide what will work best for you. In a few years, even $10 dollars a month can make a massive difference.

Now, don't buy a fake Bitcoin at etoro, RH, PayPal or similar, get the real thing. Register at a proper exchange and buy real Bitcoin. Any of these will do [https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin](https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin) 

Install (or buy - in case you're getting Bitcoin in Thousands of $) one or more of these wallets.

A few good wallet choices:

[https://blockstream.com/green/](https://blockstream.com/green/) \- Top Security Features, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://bluewallet.io](https://bluewallet.io/) \- excellent, easy to use wallet, Open Source and Non-Custodial (although, Lightning is custodial!)

[https://www.wasabiwallet.io/](https://www.wasabiwallet.io/) \- Excellent privacy, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets.

Lightning wallets to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for very small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix 

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - excellent POS for small business owners as well as integrated Bitrefill or LN Pizza

[https://muun.com/](https://muun.com/) \- Muun, simple and elegant LN wallet

Hardware Wallets (to store larger amounts):

[https://trezor.io/](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're.

[https://coldcardwallet.com/](https://coldcardwallet.com/) \- ColdCaard is currently the safest and most recommended here.

There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend as not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, etc. Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. 

Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. Write them down on any piece of paper as well as the receiving address. Now wipe the wallet and generate a new wallet. If the seed words are different than the first set, you're safe to use it. 

Find an option to set a passphrase and use it. This will boost the security to another level. Never store the seed words and passphrase together. Use a different medium if possible. If somebody finds both, they'll be able to steal your coin. 

This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words and passphrase(s) safe.

Welcome to the rabbit hole and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions anytime during your Bitcoin journey.
