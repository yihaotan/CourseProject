hipiuqz comment Search term: bitcoin mining council 
hipkmri comment a small example is you could mine some sunshine and get paid in sats to do so and also you are supporting the renewable energy industry

the bigger pictures is that theres no cheaper energy than renewables and because bitcoin mining is competative it will drive energy producers to the cheapest source of energy in order to stay competative and earn sats

also now because of bitcoin the energy grids all over the world can be built bigger and more robust and more powerful because there is always a buyer for cheap energy anywhere on the planet now..and the cheapest comes from the sun or renewables

hipkbsg comment We have a lot of newcomers entering the Bitcoin space recently who are exploring different exchanges and such. Some users are developing a habit of asking if various random websites some complete stranger PM'd them is a scam or not. Sometimes these sites are completely unrelated to Bitcoin. This is not the purpose of r/Bitcoin.

* Do not trust unsolicited messages telling you to check out some shady website.
* Do not trust Discord randos telling you that you won a prize.
* Do not trust anyone who promises guaranteed profits.
* Do not trust website with unpronounceable domain names
* Do not trust anyone claiming to give away free Bitcoin. (YouTube, Twitter, Discord)
* Do not trust anyone claiming they will double however much Bitcoin you send them.
* Do not trust 'pretty girls' on Tinder telling you about new investment opportunities.
* **If you have to ask** if some sketchy website or special offer is a scam, **then it probably is.**

You have to learn to think for yourselves. Recognize that there are many tricksters out there who will go to great lengths to separate you from your Bitcoin. Use your head and stay safe. If you send your Bitcoin to a scammer, it's gone forever. There are no refunds!

qjej8s submission Is Satoshi a group of people? 
hipl82u comment My god, you cracked the code!  After all this time!

Or perhaps he was using the ‚Äúroyal we.‚Äù 
hipt5yg comment In mathematical papers, authors will often use ‚Äúwe‚Äù or ‚Äúus‚Äù in their deductive reasoning to carry the reader along with them. That‚Äôs what I recall from the paper.

Admittedly though, if we all look at the other evidence involved, like the massively intricate and sophisticated codebase, we can all agree that the likely conclusion is that Satoshi is a group of people. 
hir13cw comment Yes satoshi stands for Stan, Anders, Tony, Oleg, Sarah, Harry and Ivan 
hipuh03 comment The whitepaper! Why didn‚Äôt we think to read that?! 

Jkjk real answer is yes it‚Äôs plausible and is actually one of the leading theories. 
hir6pyw comment There‚Äôs no way that one person have built the block chain maybe the idea came from one person but never forget one hand can‚Äôt clap so definitely Satoshi got help from others did they see him no did they talk him no it was all texting and there‚Äôs a theory that Satoshi was one of E Gold founders but he‚Äôs not stupid enough to reveal his identity because he will go to jail with no doubt 
hirxh5l comment Any one-man business will describe themselves in plural to give the impression they are more than just a one-man-show.

Bitcoin could easily be coded up by a single person in a few weeks/months time. I know lots of people (besides myself) who could do the actual coding as a one man show given the idea had already been conceived. All of the building blocks were already available at the time.

I believe it's a single person. He just happened to be brilliant enough to come up with a working architecture and have average coding skills.

hiq6o4n comment Anything mentioning "trading with bots for high returns" is 99.999999% a scam. So yeah, I'm not even going to check that and I'd say it's safe to say you should stay away from it. As for "Is this legit" checkers, they might be definig scam differently than you'd expect, so while these business may not be an outright scam they're designed to separate you from your money. Some examples of "legit" things that are also basically legally operating scams: MLMs, ETNs that are designed to go to 0, paywalling countries into difficult remittance paths just to charge exorbitant fees (Western Union), fiat exchange offices for tourists, private retirement account institution industry in EU, selling "profitable" websites and shops, selling trading courses, trading seminars with upselling, selling sports betting tips, selling membership to discord/telegram groups with crypto "signals", college textbooks in US, ink printers, timeshare properties, armour trimming i ln RuneScape etc. Once you see through one of them you'll start seeing through all of them. 
hipvt8k comment That 'too good to be true' feeling is generally always right 
hiq2lwz comment Are those sites designed to separate you from your money?  Do bears shit in the woods? 
hiqzdj9 comment If a bot is successful the scammer gets rich very fast and don't need third party investments. If the bot is losing or fake or the profit is eaten up by the fees then the programmer looks for other income, e.g. your money. But most even have neither a programmer nor a bot, they just collect money and then they disappear.

So stay away from it.

If someone invested already then the best chance is to get law enforcement freezing scammers funds at an exchange. The chances to reveal scammers privacy you can see by looking up the [bitcoin privacy score](https://btctester.com/bitcoin-privacy-score/) of the scammers BTC address (where you sent the bitcoin to). The lower the score the better are your chances. It decreases usually over time.

qjgvwe submission Hypothetical: let‚Äôs say you find a 24 word mnemonic seed phrase and you know that it has substantial BTC holdings, but you cannot return the funds to the owner. You have no idea about the wallet used to generate the seed. You want to donate the coins to charity. How would you restore the funds? 
hiq7573 comment What difference does it make if you 'want to donate the coins to charity'? 
hir2wde comment > If given a 24 word seed phrase with no other information, how do you know for sure you have found all funds that it controls?

You do not know of any coins beyond the address gap, but you can choose the size of the address gap. If the original owner was weird enough to specify a high index number derivation path for a specific address, that address has a huge address gap, and is only accessible by the person who knows the exact derivation path

The Electrum wallet was enhanced in 2020, with a try and try again technique for restoring a BIP39 wallet where only the recovery mnemonic is known. If the derivation path of your found wallet is one of the paths tested by Electrum, Electrum will recover the wallet within whatever address gap is coded into that wallet recovery feature, and it has an option for the user to ask it to try a larger address gap. The paradox is that this works best if it's your wallet and you know some transactions are missing. If it's a found wallet, you have to choose when to give up trying larger and larger address gaps  

Similarly, and with more user input, anybody can use the BIP39 tool to generate the master private key, and then test derivation paths one after another until there are coins in the address list. This is the same as the Electrum recovery, but is slower to use, and allows complete control over the process of choosing the derivation path. The BIP39 tool does not check the generated address lists for transaction history or unspent coins. The user needs to import the master public key into a watching-only wallet, or import bulk addresses or individual addresses into a watching-only wallet (because each wallet app is limited to its own address gap if you import the master public key)

> does this mean I should store/memorise both my seed phrase and also the derivation information?

Some people advise this, and also write the the name and version of the wallet app. But this approach is a half-baked response to a problem that doesn't need to exist - recovery after long-term storage  

Instead, see the recovery mnemonic as tied to the device or app which generated it, and assume that that device or app will not be available in 3 years time  

Be guided by the present-day experience of people who are unable to access some wallets created in 2011-2013  

Every 6 months, check that your wallet still works, and that it is still supported by its developer. Get a new wallet, with a new recovery mnemonic, if your existing wallet is about to become obsolete (abandoned by its developer). Send all coins from the old wallet to the new wallet

> address gaps

I suggest that it's difficult to discover the address gap limit coded into most wallet apps. Also, the gap limit could be changed from version to version, without notifying the users  

Address gap problems are unlikely for ordinary day-to-day spenders. A large address gap is likely in some Web shops which allocate a new address for every sale (everybody does this), and has a large number of uncompleted sales  

When address gap problems were more common, the recommended workaround was to send a spend-to-self transaction using one of the addresses in the gap  

Web shops with a high rate of uncompleted sales could consider using JBoK wallets instead of deterministic. A properly managed Web shop (is this too optimistic?) should have the skills and discipline to backup a full set of JBoK keys  

Existing Web shop tools (BTCPay and others) import a master public key instead of a pre-generated list of addresses. BTCPay has an address gap limit of 10000. When the Electrum developers were working on there general-purpose BIP39 recovery feature, they considered (and rejected) using BTCPay's 10000-address gap limit  

Clever people who deliberately choose a derivation path for a single key/address with a high index number are in the same basket as people who import a single key from an old paper wallet. Those one-off keys are not recoverable unless they're backed up separately. In the case of the single-key derivation path, the user can make a note of the index number or full derivation path, or the key itself. Transcription errors are inevitable 
hir5thr comment I applaud you for taking the time to learn the technical details. I feel your pain regarding the fact that some people here do not seem to understand that you are using a hypothetical scenario to motivate your research. In spite of that it seems that you have received all the info you need regarding derivation paths, gaps, etc. Just one item that I have not seen mentioned yet, passphrases. A passphrase is a separate word alongside the seed phrase. For a given seed phrase, each combination of that seed phrase with a different pass phrase represents a different wallet with a different set of addresses.

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phrase 
hiq53cu comment is the 24 seed word in order?
if so, do you not use recreate it on another wallet that can host the blockchain?
maybe i am missing something 
hiqicjv comment You destroy the seed phrase. You don't know if there are any additional backups and it's not yours to give to anyone anyway. 
hiqhzfr comment Yes, you should store the derivation information with the seed phrase. 
hiqb5sw comment I dunno. It was a hypothetical scenario, so I made up some details. 
hiqarn2 comment I dated a crazy bitch name Charity. I'm sure she'll take the btc 
hiurpom comment Thanks for the detailed reply. This is exactly what I was after. I will explain my real world use case to provide some insight into how I got here. 

I have a cold card. I set it up and recorded the pass phrase somewhere safe. If I die, my loved ones will have to access the funds via the pass phrase. I have/will tell them that this pass phrase is very important. I will put this in my will. I will provide basic instructions to restore the passphrase in a wallet. I cannot be sure that cold card as a company even exist or if any of their tools or software exists. I need to be confident my loved ones can access the funds. 

So I try it out. I send $5 worth of bitcoin over to the cold card. I send it to *literally the first address supplied to me in address explorer*. I verify the funds reach the address with multiple confirmations. 

Then I try to restore it in electrum and sparrow wallet - pretending I am a loved one trying to restore the funds using the pass phrase (remember, cold card only tell you to save the pass phrase. They say nothing about saving anything else. Neither do most tutorials for any hardware or software wallets). I restore the pass phrase to both and both of them show zero balance. 

So in other words. If I did the above and put my life‚Äôs savings in bitcoin then died, my loved ones could not access it. I think this is because the derivation path for cold card isn‚Äôt the same as electrum or sparrow. But I have NFI why. Cold card derivation path is m/0/0, literally the first and simplest derivation path. And yet neither of those wallets search there. 

And so, I panic. How can I be sure that my funds will be accessible in the future? I guess I need to save the derivation path as well as the pass phrase. And yet I was very close to not even testing this out and I would have only stored the pass phrase (like they tell you to do‚Ä¶! And like the steel wallets or whatever all tell you) and my funds would have been literally inaccessible according to you. 

Unless there is some way to comprehensively search all addresses tied to the HD wallet, which I‚Äôve yet to confirm is even possible. 
hiurvsq comment Thanks, I guess I chose too controversial of a hypothetical. 

Also thanks for the tip. I‚Äôve been using the term pass phrase but yes I meant seed phrase. For the sake of my testing I‚Äôve yet to use a pass phrase. I acknowledge the additional security it provides and may use one, but I want to get my head around the basics. 

You can see my lengthy reply to another commenter, but basically my goal is to ensure my loved ones can access my bitcoin if I die, and my previous assumptions were a seed phrase was enough. I guess that‚Äôs wrong. I need a seed phrase and derivation path information.

hit58y3 comment You have asked the question: How do I money launder?

Literally.

If you have too much cash and you need to make it look like you are making money legally then open a business that is cash heavy and start making it look like your cash came to you via that business.  Pay taxes like a good citizen and now that money is in a bank account.  Enjoy. 
hita5yw comment Not exactly, i am not talking about launder cash, dark web vendors gain money by bitcoin transactions from you wallet to their wallet. What i am wondering is: once you have the bitcoins in your wallet you can't just convert them to euro or dollars or whatever and then move rhem to the bank account because it wouls be noticed by the financial police i guess. So i am wondering what the dark web vendor do with all these bitcoins and yeah, actually how can they launder bitcoins. Make sense?

hiqzgzx comment Bitcoin is not a bank account. It is cash in your pocket. Do you split your cash currency notes according to whether the serial number is odd or even, and call the odd ones your savings account?

> a BTC "checking" address and a BTC "saving" address

A Bitcoin address is a single-use token. A Bitcoin wallet has thousands of addresses 
hiq9aqz comment Love the idea. I think you already see this kind of thing with NFTs. A friend of mine is working with a group that is making an NFT tax built into their smart contract for an NFT game. If you don't sell your NFT, you earn a percentage of the proceeds of those who do sell. If someone sells, they are taxed if the selling price is udner the price it was bought, or below the floor. 

I guess this encourages delisting, but also higher floor prices, which in effecdt makes it a savings plan. Although, if there is no liquidity, there is no point. Highly probable it could work better with something like bitcoin.

hir03xg comment > The genesis block was mined on the 3rd January 2009. Most would argue that bitcoins BIRTHday was at the time the genesis block was mined and 50 bitcoin were rewarded.

The genesis block is dated to 3rd of January. We don't know when it was mined, and the 50 btc block subsidy are unspendable. The first version of the software was released on 8th of January, and the first actually mined block happened on 9th of January.  

Not saying what of those days exactly the birthday date would be, but if we gonna be pedantic... :D 3rd of January seems to be universally accepted though, so fine with me.

hiqfvk2 comment You pay on the gain. Get a accountant to do your taxes.
Short term gains are taxed at your normal rate 
hiqgg8h comment Uk is 20% of profit. 
At $100,000 you sell 1 BTC. 
100,000-717=99283 is your profit.
Tax is 99283 x 0.2

Pretty much 20k in tax. You got to double check what your tax rate is though. 
hiqgu0t comment Don't forget to also report your losses. I did some cash purchases of crypto, turns out they were shitcoins and now worth nothing. Those losses count against my gains. 
hiqh1sd comment Depends on your income and how long you held. If you‚Äôve had your coins less than a year you‚Äôre under short term capital gains. If you‚Äôve had it longer than a year it‚Äôs long term capital gains.  You determine your gain by the price on the day you purchased (you can pick any price that day) and the price you sold at. Bought at $700 sold at $60,000 that‚Äôs $57,300 capital gains. You take that number and multiply it by your percentage based on the chart linked below. If it‚Äôs 15% - your taxes owed would be $8,595 https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/capital-gains-tax-rates 
hiqkewl comment See IRS.gov. they knew about bitcoin. 
hiqkfxl comment If you bought BTC at $715 that was over a year of holding so long term cap gains apply.
If you sold 25 today you would net over 1.5M
Taxes depend on the state, country, regular income.
Smartassets.com has a calculator.
In any case you might consider selling a small amount to help reduce the taxes.
Either way it would be wise to hire a professional accountant.

hiqh17o comment Not sure where you read they only use 1000 words.  The  word list is 2048 words long.  Words can also be repeated so the number possible combinations is essentially 2048^24.

Some checksums in there which would decrease the entropy slightly. 
hiqz4nv comment Ledger does not choose 24 words directly from a list. The Ledger is a computer, with an operating system. The operating system has an entropy generating engine, for making random numbers  

The wallet seed begins as a 256-bit random number. The 256 bits are hashed and 8 bits of the hash are appended to the 256 bits. The 264 bits are split into 24 chunks of 11 bits each. Each 11-bit chunk is a number from 0-2047. This number is used to look up a word from a pre-defined list of 2048 words  
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt  

The purpose of the word list is to be easy to write by hand on paper, and allow for transcription errors  

The security comes from the huge 256-bit size of the random number generated at the start of the process 
hir6y1i comment Holy shit OP!  If only someone would have thought of this before.  All this time, we thought encryption worked.  Turned out all we had to do was think of trying some random codes.  I mean if it could work on a bike lock it could work on a seed phrase right?

qjkn9k submission Exactly 4 years aka 1 halving cycle in Bitcoin and what I've learned 
hiqqnw4 comment Thanks for sharing this. My guess is many of us have made similar experiences over the years. With the major part of us likely having had an outcome still worse then yours.

The weird and actually sad thing is imho it'll still take some more years until people are willing to learn from third-party experiences like yours at least when it comes to bitcoin.

There are still some more years to go by until people are going to stop preferring to learn the hard way and take some expensive lessons themselves.

The virtues that bitcoin actually teaches are modesty and patience. Once the majority of newcomers is willing to follow our advice of just doing dca and hodling, the overall sentiment regarding Bitcoin not being a get-rich-quick scheme but a rock solid store of value will be taken to the next level. 
hir2y6f comment Its an old saying but still holds true- shitcoins are there to steal your bitcoins. 
hiqs9wg comment Thanks for sharing, OP. Most of us had to go through the altcoin phase before we realised what's important and what's not.

Even Steve Wozniak (Apple co-founder) recently said: "[Bitcoin is mathematics, mathematical purity. There can never be another Bitcoin created](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-is-mathematical-purity-says-apple-cofounder-steve-wozniak)."

There are no capital gains taxable this way, at least in the US, if possible though use a portion of the loan to buy stable assets like property that can later be leveraged to get your bitcoin back if it dips

hiqyo7r comment Isn't it an option to go with an exchange that offers a debit card like coinbase and crypto.com do? 

Use the debit card to pay for stuff? 
hiqpchm comment Whatever you decide to do, please DO NOT trust anyone, not even this commenter, with your seed phrase.

If I were you, I would look into peer to peer services such as localbitcoin or bisq with buyers who offer escrow options. Another option would be to slowly DCA out using an ATM, although those are pretty expensive in terms of fees.

Good luck and stay safe. 
hir3bwc comment I would honestly just transfer it to an exchange, imo the fees can be really low (Binance). The small amount you would safe for no fees would definitely not be worth the risk for me. Congrats from Switzerland, thats so cool, literally a dream for all of us haha!

hiqth6c comment In general quantum computers are only a concern if you repeatedly spend from the same address. If you follow the recommendation to never spend from any given address more than once, no qc could ever threaten you.

In short: Always use change addresses (that's what almost all state of the art wallets do) and never fund and spend from a certain address more than once.

qjlkp8 submission What‚Äòs your bitcoin investment strategy? 
hique0v comment 
>How much bitcoin do you recommend buying at once?

50% lump sum and DCA the other half.


>I‚Äòve been putting in between 100-500 per purchase every other day 

This is an excellent strategy, IMHO


>the value seems to be shooting up so fast, I don‚Äòt wanna miss out on the gains by waiting too long.

This is just FOMO playing, the price can also start dropping down. Always consider both scenarios before jumping all in. Or out.

A) Bitcoin exchange rate is at $100 million - does it really matter if you bought at $0.058 million or at $0.085 million? What matters most is that you've managed to grab some at really cheap.

B) Bitcoin is at $0. How big of regret will be buying it? Will you be able to "walk it off"?

I know, both scenarios are extreme but it made the decision making much easier for me.

Edit: a nice article https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/dca-effective-going-all-in-on-bitcoin

hirfbys comment Even if many people here go "all in" - dont do it. Not with any stock, not with bitcoin, not with cash.

Take a bigger sum you feel comfortable with and DCA. 
hiqtnk8 comment youre doing it right. the real money you will make is buying in the bear market. but even if you had bought in the mid cycle sell off that lasted from end of may until summer, youd be up 100% on your btc investment. for now just dollar cost average your way into your position. while your waiting to dump your money in have big bid orders waiting around 20k incase something weird happens like it did a few weeks ago and orders were filled at that price and lower depending on your exchange. you still have the possibility of making a 5x on your investment within the next 3-12 months depending on how long this last leg takes but history shows within the next 3 months the bear market will kick in. capture those gains and once youve got 100% on your principal, remove it and then start to ladder out of the trade as your risk appetite allows you so that you arent caught holding. sounds like you know what youre doing though, good luck

hir78qo comment OP I would wait 4-6 months to witness Bitcoin drop to 40-50k per coin, it will happen it does happen. Then just go all in at those lower levels and forget for 3-4 years. Please come back to me after that time and pay me commission fee for making you a multimillionaire 
hit3ru9 comment Here is my advice:

Have a percentage target.

Imagine you are shooting for 12% -- $8400.

That would be 1% each month into bitcoin as your percentage target.  If bitcoin zooms upward, then hold.  If bitcoin crashes downward then buy a lot more.  Have limit orders that reflect these percentages as well. 
hius2uz comment Don't be a wuss. Put it all in bitcoin. 
hius52j comment Putting in only 100-500 at a time means you're getting shafted hard by fees, doesn't it? 
hiqvqhf comment Thanks! That‚Äòs excellent advice right there. While losing it all would not be great, I‚Äòm 22 so I still got time to recover if shit hits the fan. At what point would you cash out your investments though? Seems like this whole thing just keeps on growing and I‚Äòm in it for the long run. Also, when do you buy the dip, like if it‚Äòs at 55k, how much do you let it drop before you buy? Or do you buy in regular intervals regardless of price?

hiru64m comment post the chart for 3 years then, not 10 months 
his7prz comment my biggest gripe with on chain analysts is that they dont look at the data unbiased and always spin the data in a bullish way. look at the y axis in this thing. also why denominate it in BTC and not in $BTC value? because price has gone up 3x since january meaning that even though supply declined from 2.6M btc to 2.48M btc the dollar value of that btc is still about 3x higher.

So the dollar value of BTC has tripled on exchanges.

Now if you wanted to make this metric as unbiased as possible you'd take the $value chart and divide it by volume to see how liquidity changed. it would be ok for supply to increase on exchanges if liquidity increased as well showing a healthy demand for sold bitcoin.

Considering getting a glassnode subscription to make a more unbiased analysis of the data than all the on chain moonboys try to sell. 
hiqze9t comment So a drop from ~2.68 to 2.48. That‚Äôs 0.2m or roughly 8%.

Seems negligible to me. Bulls are still in the house and we‚Äôll see an increase in price by the end of the year, but this chart isn‚Äôt an indicator of that imo.

hir19v3 comment Congrats on the move, it's never too late. ONLY INVEST MONEY YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE.

Price wise, nobody knows what the price will be tomorrow, nor next week. Statistically, it's less than four years from now. Anyone who bought Bitcoin at any point in the past and held it for 4+ years is in profit. 

**Try "Bitcoin ONLY" strategy for at least first year**, you'll sleep much better. Newcomers lose so much money, holding garbage tokens just because someone on YT told them to.

Going DCA is probably the best approach, IMHO. 
Bitcoin to me, is a savings account. If I have some spare cash, I exchange it for SATs. Once a week works best for me, but I'm getting paid weekly. If there's a 10% drop in the price since my last buy, I usually double my buy. This [DCA calculator](https://amber.app/calculate-your-investment/) might help to decide what will work best for you. In a few years, even $10 dollars a month can make a massive difference.

Now, don't buy a fake Bitcoin at etoro, RH, PayPal or similar, get the real thing. Register at a proper exchange and buy real Bitcoin. Any of these will do [https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin](https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin) 

Install (or buy - in case you're getting Bitcoin in Thousands of $) one or more of these wallets.

A few good wallet choices:

[https://blockstream.com/green/](https://blockstream.com/green/) \- Top Security Features, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://bluewallet.io](https://bluewallet.io/) \- excellent, easy to use wallet, Open Source and Non-Custodial (although, Lightning is custodial!)

[https://www.wasabiwallet.io/](https://www.wasabiwallet.io/) \- Excellent privacy, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets.

Lightning wallets to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for very small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix 

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - excellent POS for small business owners as well as integrated Bitrefill or LN Pizza

[https://muun.com/](https://muun.com/) \- Muun, simple and elegant LN wallet

Hardware Wallets (to store larger amounts):

[https://trezor.io/](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're.

[https://coldcardwallet.com/](https://coldcardwallet.com/) \- ColdCaard is currently the safest and most recommended here.

There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend as not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, etc. Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. 

Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. Write them down on any piece of paper as well as the receiving address. Now wipe the wallet and generate a new wallet. If the seed words are different than the first set, you're safe to use it. 

Find an option to set a passphrase and use it. This will boost the security to another level. Never store the seed words and passphrase together. Use a different medium if possible. If somebody finds both, they'll be able to steal your coin. 

This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words and passphrase(s) safe.

Welcome to the rabbit hole and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions anytime during your Bitcoin journey. 
hiqzfdy comment Don't buy shitcoins 
hir0w0b comment I like a guy called James from Investanswers on YouTube.

He loves btc, hates shitcoins.

Check him out. 
his6ryu comment 1. Absolutely buy Bitcoin first but know that you‚Äôre going to have to hold it through the next halving to see largest gains.  Spring 2024 is the next halving - they happen every four years or 220,000 blocks.

Time in the market is more important than timing the market.

2. Next go here and do some of your own research- 

https://coinmarketcap.com

Sort by market cap.  Look at the top coins in the list and look at their price graphs. Zoom out to see where the price is at currently.  You can also go to the markets tab to see where they sell each coin and social tab to connect with the coin‚Äôs community and see what the buzz is.

You might also look closely at the about tab and look closely at the coin‚Äôs statistics especially the circulating supply and it‚Äôs price range. 

Coins with a low circulating supply will cost the most like Bitcoin - 18.86 million coins.  Coins with a large circulating supply like 550 trillion coins will cost fractions of a cent and will never realistically reach a dollar or even a cent because it would take all
the money in the world for that to happen with 550 trillion coins!

The game is to buy low and sell high.  You may make some money or  you may lose your money if you
panic sell at a loss but eventually what happened to most here is you will realize that the only coin worth holding long term is Bitcoin .  It will take holding Bitcoin through an entire halving cycle to become a true believer .  .  . Which takes years! Then you will realize that you should be buying a little bit of Bitcoin each week regardless of the price called  - DCA dollar cost averaging. I‚Äôm talking coffee money each week. If you want to fuck around with a shitcoin go ahead but know that the best thing you could do moving forward is to DCA Bitcoin  or buy the dips when you have some extra cash.

3. Your third question requires being able to predict the future. All we have is the past to look to but as they say past performance is no guarantee of future results.  Speaking of past results Bitcoin has consistently returned almost 200% per year since it started.

Something that‚Äôs worked for me several times is to buy an inexpensive coin as soon as it gets listed on coinbase.  It‚Äôs the coinbase effect.  Many people don‚Äôt want to do the research, don‚Äôt know how to get on an exchange and want a coin that is less than $10 a piece so they can get a bunch of them.  Anytime a coin with a lot of buzz gets listed on coinbase the price tends to go up because of the reasons I listed above.  The price sometimes even goes up even with just the rumor of a coin being listed on coinbase.

Good Luck!! 
hiqydq1 comment nobody know or give you list. statistically bitcoin outperform all other coins/shitcoins. Best way to invest is to know what you are buying so learn what bitcoin is. Than buy bitcoin every week or month to average your buying price. Think about it as your saving account. Don't do shitcoins casino they might give you higher return short term but they will go to zero in bear market. It is not worth headache. 
hir3ptn comment nobody can predict the future .. but you can see how bitcoin has performed in the past for people who consistently invested over some years:

https://dcabtc.com

I wouldn‚Äôt recommend playing with any other coins .. even if they moon, they‚Äôll crash, then possibly die. if you don‚Äôt get off the ride just at the right time, it‚Äôll just emotionally wreck you and you‚Äôll be stuck with a worthless bag. 
hirhs0y comment **Only buy Bitcoin; just Bitcoin**.  

Nearly every alt-coin is a shitcoin. Maybe a handful out of many thousands are not pure scam shitcoins. All the others are pure scam shitcoins.  Most people lack the skills and knowledge to be able to discern the few non-scam coins from the long list of all alt-coins.

Shitcoins are sold to numbskulls who think they're so fucking smart that they're going to discover and buy "the next Bitcoin" early and get rich quick.

Shitcoins are created by scammers to fleece the aforementioned group.

Bitcoin is "the next Bitcoin".
