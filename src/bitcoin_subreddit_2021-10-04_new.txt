hfairbo comment Let me guess your friend is a Arab Prince who wants to invest $4 billion in BTC asking for a 15% discount on the averaged market rate using an HSBC letter of credit, but not to worry because his UK attorneys will act as escrow agents? Lol üòÇ 
hfajkeg comment 
I will send you a check for 40% over the price you are requesting for shipping and any other expenses you may incur. I‚Äôm trusting you with the excess that you will return it to me with the bitcoin 
hfaks3c comment Call this guy https://www.michael.com/

He buys $400-500 million worth at a time. 
hfaingk comment For the buying of the BTC I will be kindly sending my email info. If you are having good oppertunity I would like to be speaking to your seller for the buying. 
hfaic29 comment Downvote! 
hfaic9f comment How many coins? 
hfaisaq comment You can sell On any exchange as well as p2p exchanges platforms 
hfapk0d comment There is no limit how many bitcoins you want to dump on an exchange. That's how whales do it. 
hfapow5 comment So you want a serious buyer ‚Ä¶. Someone with a few hundred k or more to invest in bitcoin.  But you want them to buy through some guy on the internet and not through a large well known  exchange or private wealth mgmt firm??   Good luck. 
q0uezr submission Any recommendations for a no-KYC exchange where I can convert BTC to USDT and vice versa? 
hfav6ud comment https://kycnot.me/  

I assume (not going to waste time checking) kucoin has USDT. Be careful with centralized no-kyc exchanges. Even kucoin has a record of asking for proof of ID if a transaction triggers their money laundering criteria  

You didn't specify your trading amounts. With kucoin, small amounts only. Then, on a DEX, liquidity might be too low for large amounts  

Is USDT still an ETH contract. Do you have a USDT wallet? Are ETH fees really high for moving USDT around? 
hfbp9em comment Pay taxes, 
hfam4tp comment Changelly KuCoin 
hfalbn0 comment There is no converting of anything. You buy it or sell it. Try kucoin.com 5 btc per day withdrawal limit. They could set that limit to zero and require kyc at any moment for any reason though.

None of this eliminates your tax reporting and capital gains tax liability. 
hfambk5 comment What about [boltz](https://boltz.exchange/)? 
hfankfd comment Kucoin 
hfca9lq comment Changelly/Changenow.io 
hfcd8mj comment CoinEX 
hfaxqar comment Yes totally that's my concern with centralized exchanges. From all I'm reading these days, anywhere you set up and account, suddenly people are being asked for KYC on withdrawal. 

As I've been reading about Shapeshift and Orion Terminal, I find it quite awesome the new solutions that are emerging for this. Shapeshift's move from centralized exchange to DEX is particularly impressive I find. However, there the Ledger integration isn't working yet however, and for Orion, I'm having a hard time figuring out the pathways. Both seem really interesting though. 

As for wallets, for now I've been using just the ledger and metamask when trading on uniswap.

q0v854 submission What would keep the bitcoin running after all of it is mined? Do prices have to stay high enough to incentivize continued mining and hence power up the network? 
hfar04m comment Transaction fees 
hfatjme comment We can‚Äôt know for sure since you and I would be dead by then. But if Bitcoin fulfilled its mission as becoming the reserve asset of the world then the world (government) will set aside budget for securing it. Of course unless the fees are high enough then miners then Bitcoin hash rate can still survive without government subsidies. 
hfar3uj comment If I‚Äôm not mistaken the proof of work or tracking of the coins will be what keeps it running I could be wrong tho. 
hfbcqjn comment It‚Äôs transaction fees - and the price needs to continue to climb to support a low tx fee percentage based off the asset price, otherwise, validators would leave, and yeah, that‚Äôd be bad news 
hfauonl comment you should learn how bitcoin works 
hfauhr1 comment Prices will fall. Rewards will be transaction fees only. Transaction fees will be minimal (because fees are chosen by the transaction sender, not charged by the miners). There will be fewer miners. Bitcoin will keep mining 144 new blocks every day  

> incentivize

This isn't a word 
hfbqtfz comment Its like a theme park.

Most people pay the minimum to get in and ride the rides, but may wait hours in line.

Others will gladly pay more for a wristband to skip the line.

You pay a fee for someone to not only ‚Äútransport‚Äù your Bitcoin, but to immutably verify and record it happened.

hfbah93 comment It makes sense for those reducing fees and getting away from centralization to use it with lightning network etc. But for much of the population, it‚Äôs just an asset with highly superior qualities.  There are some good comparisons of the internet adoption from the 1997 /1998 years which you can Google or Duck search and then compare the current users estimated to be in the 300 million range. To me I think we are more like internet 1998 but I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm outnumber with those that say 1997. 
hfbqdys comment Lol exactly my point too. People act like an entirely new asset class and financial system should just be adopted out of the gate. 
hfd8ys1 comment Bingo

In order for something to be a medium of exchange it needs to proven as a store of value 

And for something to have long term value it goes through short term volatility

This is my response to most people. 
hfbfjbo comment No you can't. 

You can auto sell crypto and credit a visa account whenever you make a purchase. 

This is not fundamentally any different than selling a bit on any exchange every month and transferring the cash to your bank account, just more frequent. 
hfbgate comment I get what you are saying but its pointless.

Your are arguing that selling crypto into fiat and buying with fiat all in an instant isnt the same, but its just as dumb as saying you hold cash until you buy something. Sure the dollar dropped and you held but you  sold your cash for what its worth and traded it. 

You had 10 beaver pelts in currency held till  they were worth more sold and traded the currency for food. Its the same as it has always been. In the space of an instant you traded a goods/service for something you wanted. The value of the intermediate matters little in an instant.

hfbqrp0 comment this is a bad news. 
hfcnueo comment A futures vehicle will allow Wall Street to more effectively hedge against BTC volatility. Right now institutions can only do that thru ‚Äòphysical‚Äô borrowing, which is difficult in environments like now where 90+% BTC is being hodled, much of it in-wallet.

The SEC can‚Äôt maintain control over spot BTC, but they keep control over futures market contract-trading.

Gensler is walking a fine tightrope between establishing acceptance of BTC while not letting it threaten the established system. He‚Äôs probably the best hope we could have for someone in an adversarial position.

Keep in mind that contract delivery of BTC is effortless and instantaneous‚Ä¶unlike precious metals futures where contract delivery is practically infeasible. This should ensure integrity in a BTC futures market to a far, far greater extent than in the clearly corrupt pm markets.

I don‚Äôt love this push by the SEC‚Ä¶but for that last reason it likely won‚Äôt be the reigning in of BTC that it has been for gold & silver.

Take kale for example, before it became an expensive health food it was basically garbage and Pizza hut was the world's largest kale buyer to use it as decoration for salad bars. What proportion of the kale prices today comes from intrinsic value? Was it underpriced before or overpriced now? The deeper you go the more it seems there is no intrinsic value in the price of anything and whatever people are willing to pay is what something is *actually* worth.

hfboj1a comment You still have to be able to pay your repayments. I think it more refers to savings and investments 
hfbovz5 comment The smart thing to do is borrow the funds and reinvest them into another vehicle. If you reinvest the money into something that brings in more cash flow than your expenditure, you won‚Äôt have to keep taking progressively larger loans.

IE borrow 500k, buy a rental property (just an example, I know it‚Äôs not necessarily the best option).if your expenditure per month is 2k and the property brings in 2500, then you won‚Äôt need to take progressively larger loans but will still benefit from capital appreciation 
hfc745g comment The Estate is liable for the debt. The Trustee must pay off the estate's debts prior to distributing funds as indicated in the Will.
Most likely the BTC is held in escrow, so no dissapearing shenanigans, so unless the "child" can come up with principal owing (second mortgage?) the required amount of BTC will be sold to satisfy the debt. 
hfcfjql comment This is a tactic wealthy people do. Famously, the Trump family does it but it seems to be catching up to them. 

The idea is your borrow money against your portfolio and other assets to fund your living style. You continue to borrow forever until you die. When you die your estate must pay back the debt.

The important tax implication is your cost basis resets when you die. So instead of getting taxed on your $500k in BTC throughout your life as you sell that cost basis is reset. You pay out the 400k with no taxes and the rest goes to your heirs.

q0zgj7 submission Why do WIF keys sometimes start with L and sometimes with K? 
hfek9a1 comment The base58 character set used in Bitcoin represents the numbers from 0-57

    123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz

'K' and 'L' are 18 and 19  

The WIF key is 304 bits  

* x'80'  
* 256-bit secp256k1 key
* x'01'  
* 32-bit checksum  

Conversion to base58 is as learned in high school - repeated division by 58, using the remainders to fill the digit positions from right to left  

The result of the final division is constrained by the length of the WIF key - 304 bits - and the fixed value of the first 8 bits - '00001000'  

Repeated division by 58 of an integer with these constraints will always give a 52-digit number beginning with 'K' or 'L' (18 or 19)

You're all nuts and will believe anything.

hfd3si4 comment Somebody is very desperate to see some correlation. 
hfc9xpa comment I don't have an opinion on plan b's work, but he does seem to have a variety of models and projections, applying the one that is most accurate at the time.

The projected floor isn't derived from s2f, which is a different model to s2fx.

Nothing wrong with proposing different models and seeing if any of them work out, and his floors have been accurate over the past few months, but it does seem like he's in a position where whatever happens outside a complete collapse, one of them will be accurate within a margin of error.

So, you've already blown it, because we hit a new ATH of $66.9K two weeks after you posted your bullshit.  We'll see how things go over the last two months of the year. 
hfcea1g comment He's wrong.  I'm not going to say how I know.  I know.

As for proposing multiple models and seeing if they work out...  That is complete bullshit.  Choose your cliche - a stopped clock is right 2 times a day, throw something and see what sticks, etc.

Over the past 9 years there have been so many people here pushing their TA that has been proven categorically incorrect that it's laughable.

Every single person who has had some sort of notoriety since bitcoin initially launched and has made some prediction has been ridiculously wrong and we now never hear from most of them again.

Plan B is the latest.  Everyone eats it up.

You do you.  I'm pretty confident I've been here longer than ~98 percent of those who post here.

If I'm wrong about anything, I will always own it.  I know I am not in this case.

q0zm4b submission Tool/script to calculate random address from xpub? 
hfbnucf comment Any wallet app which accepts an xpub as a watching-only wallet should display the next available unused address just by selecting "Receive". You don't want a random address because that will create an address beyond the gap 
hfc4mty comment Why a random address and not just the next unused one ? 
hfbn5hd comment This IMHO, could be quite dangerous, considering you would trust the online tool never to get hacked and generate address you don't own the keys from. 
hfc4fre comment [deleted] 
hfbo000 comment Bluewallet is showing 26 different addresses I can receive from. Those are all valid right? 
hfbxx9t comment Mind the gap 
hfdevj4 comment That would be fine too 
hfbncxj comment True. I‚Äôd prefer a script that could run offline and sandboxed.

I‚Äôm sure keeping your xpub online would be even more of a threat than just reusing addresses.

Right now I just copied a list of 5 addresses and set it to randomly choose one to send coins to. They‚Äôll be reused but not as frequently as just one. 
hfcgp7l comment Most of them were scams.  They used intentionally defective code to limit the search space so that the people who put them out there could steal whatever BTC users had sent to addresses generated with those scripts.

Bitaddress.org was one that was legitimate, if you downloaded it from the official Github repo.  I don't know if the repo is still available and still legitimate.  I wouldn't trust the website (which is still up) for obvious reasons.

hfd04dl comment Hello world,

I' am looking for a way to be paid in bitcoins in my website.

I would like to know, what is the best method for a novice consumer to

1. Create a wallet (to buy bitcoins)
2. Send them to me then. (with the least cost + easiest way to do it)

I heard that bluewallet was a good option but as I see, it cost 5% of the amount in transactions fees.

hfd8y5f comment What's the best strategy for obtaining more bitcoin? Timing the market to sell when its at the top, and buy when it dips? I'm already hustling side jobs to buy more bitcoin. Some other folks state to just HODL, but that could miss out on new opportunities? Exit strategy after this bull market (maybe after Q1 2022)?

When Lambo? I hear it all the time, don't buy a stupid Lambo with your BTC. I had a 911 and loved it. I sold it raise funds to buy two commercial real estate properties. I just sold those two properties to buy BTC and have a couple of coins. I'm hoping when BTC hits top to take one BTC out of my portfolio to treat myself. I tell my wife, I want a Lambo in my 30s, not in my 50s.  I plan to use the rest of BTC for retirement, or to pass it to my daughter or future family. Sounds like I made my mind, but I'm open to others' plans.

hfbmk40 comment If they don‚Äôt know that you can buy fractional Bitcoin, then they definitely should do some more research before jumping in. Currently you can buy as little as 0.00000001BTC for $0.00048. 

There‚Äôs no disadvantage of owning fractional Bitcoin. If you have 0.01BTC or 0.1BTC and the price goes up 20%, you‚Äôve increased your investment by 20% in either scenario.

It‚Äôs really elementary-level basics. If that‚Äôs too much to learn, it‚Äôs probably best for them to stay away until they‚Äôre willing to put in the 30 seconds worth of time.

Just my 2 sats. 
hfbnpqx comment We just need to leave the word "bitcoin" to describe the network only, and refer to "SATs" when talking about the coins.

hfbom7y comment Do most people honestly think you need to buy a full coin at $48000? 
hfbmg0t comment I don't think sats are too expensive at all. 
hfbppcp comment This doesn't require a dangerous controversial change to the data structure of bitcoin. It's simply a front end ui change to display "bits" or thousandths of a bitcoin. Many sites like Bitcoinity have been experimenting with this since 2014 but it is not popular. There are already other things preventing bitcoin from appealing to the poor right now,  particularly transaction fees. 
hfc6n3y comment Everyone appears to be against this here, buy I think you‚Äôre right as far as fast adoption and increase in price.  Stock splits have frequently caused jumps in the price, because like it or not, most people will see a lower price as more affordable.  Similar reason why everything for sale ends in $0.99.  If Sats start becoming widely adopted, that will work the same.  I also wish Sats were at 1 million or billion to keep with normal practices. 
hfbmp8j comment We're very close to the point where only wealthy people will be able to acquire a whole coin. Also to the mass usage of satoshi instead of bitcoin. Some exchanges already switched to satoshi standard, some will do in the near future.
When you go down the rabbit hole, you'll realise that even the whole Bitcoin network, never used bitcoin since the beginning - always satoshis.

Satoshi is currently pretty cheap, about 2,000 per USD, check them out. Pegged to Bitcoin, no shitcoin inside, I promise.

Bottom line, Snowden genuinely doesn't know what he's talking about when it comes to Bitcoin. No need to put him on a pedestal for everything he says.

hfbq92g comment Most technological advancements have happened under the gold standard. And investments are better in a deflationary environment. Being the money a scarce commodity, you'll think much more about how to spend it, contrary to what happens today. 

Most of the money printing doesn't go toward good investments but rather toward corruption and bad investments in order to buy votes from the ignorant people. 
Today you have to get in debt do start a business or to buy a house. The bank gives loans easily, because that's easy money, printed with a click, not earned. In a gold standard, you must work and save in order to get a capital to start a business. And once you do, being that money the result of your swear, you'll plan much better.

The UDI doesn't change anything. If everyone has free money, the few people who work will ask for a much higher price for their product, they won't exchange their labor for your common and easy good.

In the same way, under the gold standard, prices will go down, because the money is harder and scarcer. The result of automation in such a scenario should be the natural one: people working less for a higher price. As it should be. 
World population should decrease, people should work way less and let the robots do the job, and for the few hours they work, they should be paid more.


Read the bitcoin standard. This topic is talked about in detail. 
hfbw3lk comment Investing your capital to bring new products and services to market is potentially much more profitable than just sitting on your bitcoin and waiting for it to appreciate over many years.

People want to live now and they will spend money on food, weddings, education, travel, etc. regardless of how much that money would be worth in the future. Time is our scarcest resource and people give up their bitcoin to live. 

Also, Bitcoin discourages unnecessary spending. You may skip the next iPhone version if your device still works. You may rather save and build capital. If people have capital because they were encouraged to save they can finally get out of salary slavery and start businesses they are passionate about. Bitcoin could encourage more startups and more innovation actually. 
hfbp67q comment Inflationary money policy also animates people to move their money somewhere that holds its value - gold for example.

Money that has to be spent, will be spent no matter the monetary policy and its current value. 

So i guess it's a little more complicated than that.
Also the potential upside for bitcoin is a plus for every owner. 
hfbvbha comment >hoarding.

Common people don't hoard money, whatever it's value. All inflation does is make it more difficult to SAVE money, and more costly to live. 

&#x200B;

> Salary slavery never ending.

You worry about creating a condition that most of the world is already living under? Seriously, who here isn't already a salary slave? Even "hoarding" bitcoin for the past 5 years, I might never be able to retire with the current inflationary pressures. Have you even been to a grocery store lately?

&#x200B;

>spending/investment is discouraged by adopting BTC

Entirely false premise; no it isn't. Wasteful spending is discouraged, and investment solely for the sake of turning a profit is discouraged. Monetary incentives become balanced. People are naturally competitive and will continue to innovate because the driving desire to do so isn't driven solely by profit. 

&#x200B;

> CBDCs would of course require very good privacy provisions otherwise it would unleash horrible Orwellian dystopia.

I don't see privacy ever happening in a CBDC. We're already in an Orwellian dystopia; it will only get worse with a CBDC.

&#x200B;

>but this LEGAL TENDER thing seems to be quite scary, don't you think?

Yes, the dollar is terrifying right now. It's slow degradation is now advancing rapidly. 
hfbp2lg comment I think you are missing the point that bitcoin is not the *only* legal tender. So is usd. Nothing will change, those that want to hoard bitcoin could have done so regardless, those that won't still don't have to.

Personally I think a large majority will still only use usd and this will end up being a failed experiment. 
hfbwv48 comment When fully adopted, BTC is just an efficient store of value: there will be marginal incentive for hoarding. If you want gains, you still need to invest. 
hfep2x0 comment Most monetary policy is complete bull shit. You‚Äôve been fed lies your whole life so of course you‚Äôd find it confusing that hard money could work as currency. But it does, and it will. 
hfbqk3q comment Oh man your description shows that you don't truly grasp the idea of what money is and how it actually works. Keep digging deeper it'll come to you eventually. When it does you'll be kicking yourself for ever thinking this way. 
hfbqcu1 comment There is a big change-owning USD you have to use a bank account to enable spending of it to others (unless physically there with the cash).

This is an admission that the new financial system will be utilized by the people in conjunction with institutions, but the institutions will have to adopt.

Countries not allowing both choices are now taking a risk that major intellectual capital and pure capital will leave their country. The wealthy and the poor share a common thread that bitcoin is fast becoming the asset they save in, and use when they need to.

Some countries will try to clamp down on everyone aka China. I think other nations are betting that this is not a good bet to keep themselves in power. This is also an attempt to revitalize their economies (or lose their power). 
hfbril7 comment I do agree with you. Buying Bitcoin is genius, currency no. 

Although to argue against myself one could argue that making it legal tender will push many of the citizens of that country to look into Bitcoin more and hopefully start holding it themselves, which otherwise wouldn't happen

Of course, favorable legal frameworks help, but I believe education helps more. The more people know and understand the basics of Bitcoin and what it can do for them, the closer we'll be to mass adoption. 
hff9gut comment I disagree. It‚Äôs not any nation that will decide the future of bitcoin. It‚Äôs the people, it‚Äôs us. I personally think bitcoin is the greatest store of value ever created, so I will be storing a portion of my wealth there forever. 

If enough people agree with me literally nothing can stop bitcoin. Not even the almighty Joe Biden.

About trusting the transfer, from what I gathered people usually wait for the 1st confirmation, that usually takes a few minutes, I think? 
hfco04w comment It‚Äôs just inconvenience. What are you going to do with the cash? Make a trip to the bank to deposit it, an extra step, and if you‚Äôre one of us, you‚Äôre just going to end up buying Bitcoin with it anyway.

hfptf0l comment You can do either, within an SMSF 
hff8epe comment That depends how you set it up. It's expensive when done via Accountants, much cheaper if you do it yourself using an SMSF warehouse such as EsuperFund (running costs, all up, are circa $1500 p/a I think).  


Make sure you choose the right warehouse though as some let you buy bitcoin only from their short "authorised" list of exchanges and others (such as esuperfund, my fav) let you buy from ANY Aussie exchange.

Any queries, please let me know (here or via DM).

hfc6b6z comment Don't sell your Bitcoin for an entire house.
A house is a traditional asset and in most Western countries a low rate mortgage for 80-90% of the value can be had from local lenders. All that is required is proof of income (a job) and a down payment...I could see using some of your BTC for the DP especially if your ability to save is limited. But definitely use your income in fiat to pay your mortgage.
BTW with the recent global appreciation of housing price now is a bad time to buy a house, wait if possible 
hfcn299 comment Would not. I am however considering using my btc as collateral to get a loan and purchase property. There aren't many great products that allow this yet, too expensive currently, however this will be [expanding soon](https://twitter.com/nvk/status/1444814125905948672?s=19) and changing in the near future as institutions realize that bitcoin is perhaps the best collateral to ever exist. 
hfc0ujz comment For me it depends on where bitcoin is in its journey, I think we still have 10-15 years maybe more of strong price increase before it may start to level off so in that period I would generally try and keep hold of as much bitcoin as possible. 
hfbzsut comment To be honest, i am in 2 minds about this. I invested in bitcoin to start so I can earn enough to buy a house (this was always my end goal)  
But now i see a lot more protential and was thinking about getting a loan against my BTC to buy a house eventually. But i have not decided on my course of action yet. 
hfbz24s comment Yeah I actually would. I live in Ireland and my government have made it basically impossible for someone in my position to own a house without buying it cash up front. 
hfd5lfa comment Bought a house in 2017 instead of btc and every single day in my life i regret this decision 
hffqdlw comment get a fixed rate mortgage that way your payments will be less over time compared with the value of the dollar 
hfc4js4 comment I would look into borrowing money and using the bitcoin as collateral, keep your assets if at all possible. I mean you pay some type of rent so as long as you can cover the payments or match them. Maybe see if there is a way to pay interest only if property values increase in your area, use what normally you spend on principal and invest in more bitcoin (in my humble opinion) 
hfc6yoo comment In your position if its difficult to obtain a house it makes sense. When you can easily get a house loan or refinance and you have 2-3 percent interest, you can use that borrowed loan to multiply your investments and increase your wealth. You should be able to diversify and beat 10 percent return while also gaining property returns of another 10 percent. Basically you doubled your investment capital effectively and are paying 1‚Äì1.5 percent now on the total. 
hfccr7z comment Hell no. 
q121dy submission Short-Term Mindset ‚Äî People Are Not Interested in Buying Bitcoin at $41K, but Rush To Buy at $47K. It is time to switch to a long-term mindset with Bitcoin. 
hfc09h7 comment Because people buy into greed not Into fear... When they  should be greedy when the market is fearful... 
hfbzpgk comment It's always amazing how quickly sentiment can turn around in the Bitcoin world. In a matter of hours, the market goes from extreme fear to a neutral sentiment that is close to greed.

That's what we experienced on October 1. Again, if I may say so.

Many were hesitant to buy Bitcoin at $41K in the hope that it would go even lower. $38K was the target that kept coming up. But even at $38K, these people would have waited even lower and not acted.

However, as soon as the price of Bitcoin rebounds sharply to $47K, then everything changes and these people start to want to buy it. It's amazing how much power a $4K green candle can have.

This reveals a problem of a mindset that is too short-term oriented. To take full advantage of Bitcoin, you have to switch to a long-term mindset. That is the key. 
hfc5pj4 comment FOMO Arigato Mr Roboto 
hfd0ykq comment Once it goes closer to $50k the hive minds immediately just start thinking of the jump to $100k. At $41k the mind only thinks of the jump to $50k. Either way, it's a long term hold and $9k price difference won't matter much 10 years from now. 
hfc5ula comment The vast majority of exchange volume is driven by trading. That's true in every financial market... Forex, securities, futures, it's all speculation. There are people buying and holding, but their volume is much smaller. 
hfd7dkf comment Doesn't matter much.

$41K and $47K are both bargain prices. 
hfdjg37 comment tldr; Bitcoin broke out of a Falling Wedge on October 1, 2021. The shorts that were waiting for a fall in the price of Bitcoin were liquidated, which allowed the falling wedge to be exited at the top. Bitcoin has everything it takes to beat its April 2021 ATH and go much higher. Bitcoin‚Äôs time has come and its revolution cannot be stopped.

SMART MONEY accumulates deep into value and/or dollar cost average in at a consistent rate knowing how much they will remove once they reach certain targets, and how much they will leave in. 
hfe9o7d comment 100% spot on.

If you want to know how to do that correctly, take a look at the people following GME. Those guys were fanatical about "buying the dip".

If one can learn to control their FOMO instinct and DCA instead they will be in a much better position than snap buying or selling when the market makes a big move.

If you prefer, ladder in with progressively larger buys on limit orders as the price drops down. Just don't FOMO in or out in one step. It almost never results in a optimal outcome. 
hfetyut comment Sure, but as it drops I get greedy. I‚Äôm hoping to get more cheaper. 

It works both ways/doesn‚Äôt work.

q12hvr submission Op-ed: Did Peter Thiel Predict Bitcoin 22 Years Ago? 
hfd2m7p comment >In 1983, the American cryptographer David Chaum conceived an anonymous cryptographic electronic money called ecash.[7][8] Later, in 1995, he implemented it through Digicash,[9] an early form of cryptographic electronic payments which required user software in order to withdraw notes from a bank and designate specific encrypted keys before it can be sent to a recipient. This allowed the digital currency to be untraceable by the issuing bank, the government, or any third party.

>In 1996, the National Security Agency published a paper entitled How to Make a Mint: the Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash, describing a Cryptocurrency system, first publishing it in an MIT mailing list[10] and later in 1997, in The American Law Review (Vol. 46, Issue 4).[11]

>In 1998, Wei Dai published a description of "b-money", characterized as an anonymous, distributed electronic cash system.[12] Shortly thereafter, Nick Szabo described bit gold.[13] Like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that would follow it, bit gold (not to be confused with the later gold-based exchange, BitGold) was described as an electronic currency system which required users to complete a proof of work function with solutions being cryptographically put together and published. 

Wow, what an amazing prediction of something people had been working on for decades. 
hfdjfxk comment tldr; PayPal co-founder and venture capitalist Peter Thiel predicted Bitcoin's existence before the 21st century. He predicted that the world would move away from government-backed currencies to "purely private currencies" with no medium of exchange. However, he wasn‚Äôt referring to Bitcoin. Instead, he imagined a new barter economy that would digitally tokenize goods and services.

Humanity is doomed to be exploited by the rich and powerful, as it always has, no matter the flavour you pick.

The puppets running governments are irrelevant (unless you're in a totalitarian regime getting killed by your leaders), because central banks behind every democracy and corporations are the true rulers.

I just want to be left alone and live my life how I want. I don't know how to define that "political" orientation, but bitcoin can definitely help me achieve this goal. 
hfcc43p comment Non-affiliated/Independant - I want to pick who‚Äôs best for my current interests. 

Politics at the highest levels are a system of control.  The two main political parties in the U.S. are two sides of the same coin and work for the same masters- big business. They intentionally pick emotionally charged issues. Then they pick a side and fan the flames with the media.  Its obvious what they‚Äôre doing but very hard not to get pulled into the debate and chose a side.  It‚Äôs divide and conquer.  While we squabble, the politcians then do what they really want - enrich themselves and their buddies!   It‚Äôs gotten to the point where friends & families are divided and don‚Äôt speak to each other anymore because of politics!

Personally after the last several years I'm burnt out on politics. It's clear that our two-party system is in truth a one-party system with a silly toy slider that moves from left to right. I'm more interested in the adoption of technologies that empower individuals and de-fang the state. Global internet access, Bitcoin, 3D printers, localised electricity production, etc.

hfcpuqn comment Not the cheapest but absolutely best customer service when you need. Normal app works fine, Pro version is better for traders. Nice POS staking management, also works for DOT/KSM parachains. 
hfcp5uq comment Yes, I use Kraken and Gemini. Both are excellent. They both have a set up like coinbase/coinbase pro, cheaper to use the pro side on all 3.

Coinbase has become shady, in my opinion. And if your money gets locked up, you'll be fighting that fight for years. Coinbase and binance are both places I will not do business any longer.

I don't need to when Kraken does it all, and does it better/cheaper/faster. 
hfd2ijn comment Definitely a good option 
hfcq5vb comment I use it as my primary market. They have good customer service and everything functions very well. You can trade in the app but have to go to the website for deposits and withdrawals. They have 2FA support and for a small volume investor for me they work well.

q1486i submission Q: Is the book, "The Blocksize War: The battle over who controls Bitcoin‚Äôs protocol rules" worth reading? 
hfcegw0 comment

Absolutely!


>Preferably I would like to read something that looks at the block size wars objectively. 

That will never happen. Don't get me wrong, I believe it's objective but I'm, like many others, on the side that won the war. Anyone from the other side will probably say the opposite, most of them without even reading the book.

This is happening outside the crypto space too. Had recently someone telling me they're not interested in reading a history book because it's author is on the other side of political spectrum and pointed to another one. I read both and guess what? Both authors described the main points of the history exactly the same.

This book is also about history and the facts IMHO, can't be changed.
Here's a short review: https://youtu.be/6YtS5ZNuuTw

hfce5ys comment Actually reading it now! I like it, very informative (but not too overly technical) about an issue I had heard of, but never really new all the details. 
hfd976e comment It was a pretty great book and I definitely recommend it. See my response to /u/xboox for my reasoning. 
hfffpjm comment Bcash was born because a few people did not fully understand Bitcoin and thought that the bitcoin scripting language was not useful to create L2 solutions thereby preventing Bitcoin to scale. These people wanted Bitcoin to be global currency asap and become rich as fuck. The end result, they got rekt. Lesson: You are going to get burned in Bitcoin, if you don't remain patient. Even Satoshi himself could have created higher block rewards and would have ultimately allowed mining to be finished in 10-20 years, instead they chose 128 years. Great societal change happen slowly but have far reaching beneficiary results! 
hfcwjzs comment bcash whores wrote a book?  
that's hilarious !!! 
hfcgqqc comment I haven't read it yet, maybe I will, but I dunno why I should read about something I experienced first hand lol.
I still know how toxic the community was back when and I actually still see how toxic the community still is for people that think the blocksize war isn't over. 
hfck2oj comment A bit technical is nice otherwise a lot of information will be missed out. Thanks for the insight though I guess I will buy it :) 
hfd8pxx comment The book takes a pretty measured stance with regards to both sides of the conflict. The author is not a big blocker by any means, but he doesn't shy away from criticizing small blockers in their mistakes.

Had I been in the community back then I probably would have been a small blocker.
