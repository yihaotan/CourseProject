It's like reddit's front page.

qgk762 submission Good evening y’all. I need educated answers to the following questions 
hi6pwxt comment 1. Because it is a tool for personal sovereignty.

2. Because they're 18% of global population.

3. Migrated to freer countries, and it's very good for everyone but the Chinese. 
hi6pjtc comment Bitcoin gives no fucks about China. 
hi6w4uy comment 1.  Bitcoin promotes and provides freedom.  The Chinese government wants to subjugate/enslave its citizens.  

2. It doesn't affect the markets.  The rest of the world is free to buy and sell Bitcoin.  

3.  Learn about black markets and bribery. 
hi6x1jr comment 1. commie dictators are commie dictators.  learn something about it.  

2. because commies are irrelevant to capitalism. their entire society is parasitic. they depend on wealthy nations to steal intellectual property from so they can pretend to be modern while remaining a backwards authoritarian police state which produces very little value compared to their population size.  

3. they moved to more free countries, where capitalism reigns and produces everything they intend to steal later.  here's a little secret though: chinese people still hold bitcoin, and are mining bitcoin privately. 
hi6pzn9 comment Would love to hear the answers to these questions 
hi6vllq comment Chyna sucks ass. They’re a commi country that needs face recognition from their ppl to even install apps. Recognition that is used to ID ppl on the street cameras and much more. IE: Regulated… Chyna wants to unveil their own digital currency… Miner’s from Chyna… unsure, but theres been a crackdown for sure. As to if they can mine… I imagine ppl there have found a VPN to not get detected and more. But it seems mining ops are headed to other places. 
hi6zw3n comment Luckily I moved to Canada and my current cryptocurrency holdings were not affected as they banned BTC which also caused market volatility 
hi764sm comment 1. China has an authoritarian government and bitcoin gives its citizens a way to exit their economy. 

2. China is very big. 

3. it’s been shown that a lot of the miners have moved to other places around the globe where mining is allowed, the ones who stayed behind had their equipment sold. 
hi7ru14 comment > Why is it that China being big on technology banned Bitcoin/crypto and emphasize that it’s more bad than good?

China oscillates between giving business free reign and exerting control. Also, Bitcoin is not technology, it is a money token. As a money token, it is an opportunity for wealthy Chinese to circumvent capital export controls. China is still a relatively weak, developing economy, can not afford unconstrained money leakage

> Why is it that China’s ban on crypto affects the market so much?

It doesn't

> Does miners from China just stop mining or they migrated ?

Some quit. Some moved their miners to Siberia or Kazakhstan. Some quit and sold their miners on secondary markets. Most of those miners ended up in Siberia and Kazakhstan 

> Is this a good or bad thing ?

Neutral

hi75oqm comment Is there any evidence that they did though? Wouldn’t a more reasonable headline be “Anyone who bought bitcoin last March is up 10x”

Doesn’t have to be with bailout money. 
hi73va7 comment tldr; Americans who received $1,200 from the US government as a result of the pandemic and invested in Bitcoin have multiplied their money about 10 times since then. The introduction of more dollars into circulation has caused the dollar to accelerate its loss of purchasing power as the US is currently facing one of its biggest periods of inflation.

qglaw6 submission Wealth Tax Math (aka Unrealized Capital Gains Tax) 
hi6y4fs comment Fuck usd... I'm off to Portugal 
hi71g8p comment The unrealized capital gains tax in the U.S. would apply to only about 700 people, billionaires. 

In other words, the proposed tax doesn't apply to you. It will not consume any of your unrealized gains. 
hi6xiod comment Yeah it won’t work. Dumbest thing in the world. 

Capital will leave the US faster then Powell can print it. 
hi796t8 comment Yes, you are correct.  The purpose of the wealth tax is to gradually confiscate everything.  It will initial start with billionaires, then within a few years move down to millionaires, and eventually apply to all citizens.  The government confiscation of all private property is a central concept of Marxism.  This is how it starts. 
hi7331o comment Income tax started like that too. 
hi706at comment Where would they go China? 🤣 

Give me a break. So long as the US has world reserve currency status and adheres to the rule of law (which is questionable considering a traitor is still walking free) the capital will fly here in droves. 
hi6xtuc comment Shouldn't work, but that hasn't stopped them before.  Who would have to votes to block it? 
hi73vfl comment Back in the good ole days the top marginal rate for income tax was 90%. But it applied to very few people. The reason that the U.S. tax code evolved into what it is today is due to the efforts of those same very few. 
hi75xbl comment Not China… That’s for sure. 
hi7602v comment Has the government ever not flexed a new power that they were granted? I find it hard to believe a government would restrain itself from more broadly applying the tax or more people being pushed into that bracket due to inflation. 
qglcgi submission Does this Newbie investment strategy make sense? 
hi70lf8 comment Dump the $1000 in now, less maintenance than tryna dca 100$ every time there's a moderately sized dip. 
hi6zqsr comment I vote go all in now.  Then DCA whatever is in your comfort zone.   Even if it's only $10 a week. 

Note:  if you haven't already decided on an exchange Gemini has a promo with a $100 investment within 3 days they'll give you $25 in BTC. 
hi75ahk comment Buy it all now , on a hardware wallet , then dont think about it for a few months 
hi79r89 comment no. just buy. hold. forget about it. trading isn't investing. buying is investing. selling is divesting.  bitcoin isn't a pump and dump scheme. it's going to continue changing the world, not by being something people buy and then dump immediately. if you want to be a day trader, then go find a day trading sub. this is a bitcoin sub. 
hi6xyan comment Buy and hold Bitcoins, just Bitcoins, long term and with a strong hand. Never sell Bitcoins in any attempt to time the market. Never invest money you might need w/in the next five or ten years. Maintain an emergency cash cushion, and consider holding an emergency credit card with no annual fee, zero balance, and a high limit so that you won't ever be forced to sell any of your Bitcoins.

Remember: TA is pure bullshit. Day trading is for fools. Fools and their money are soon parted.

The above strategy has enjoyed a long term average ROI of about 135% per year.

If 135% per year isn't enough for you, it means you're fucked up and you might consider seeking treatment.

hi7bnw7 comment Transfer all your crypto to a hard wallet. Get in a boating accident where your hard wallet is lost at sea. 
hi7akul comment move it to another wallet. make sure the new wallet is tor native, and you initiated the wallet with tor enabled. perhaps behind a vpn just to make sure there are no leaks. because if the wallet's node reads your ip address, you're pwned. i suppose it depends who you are defending against, but a thorough forensic investigation might reveal your ip if you aren't very careful.  download the wallet using tor browser too.  and if you are using your computer right now or this reddit account from this computer at any time in the past, without tor or vpn, then it's really already too late since your intentions have now been made public and are now connected to your reddit account, and all ip addresses you have ever used to log into it.  and deleting this post doesn't actually delete it.

hi73mog comment I am a Bitcoin and crypto enthusiast and also plant based/vegan! Sooo 👍 
hi73p6t comment seems to me the fiat system treats animals most horrifically and uncaring

if robert breedlove is talking about it then maybe he seen something in how the monetory system if changed can also fix that..hes a good bitcoin philosopher 
hi7ea68 comment I’m a vegan animal rights activist as well as a big believer and hodler in Bitcoin. In my opinion, these two beliefs share a lot in common, since both Bitcoin and animal rights are two things that would make the world a more fair and respectful place to live in. 
hi74gtt comment Possibly. On a hard money standard, we present the argument of less consumption. You wouldn’t have the same incentives to spend your money, only when you need to. 

However, central banks rely on spending and inflation (aka growth) but how can we grow forever on a planet with finite resources? Also, technology causes deflation so central banks are constantly trying to counter act that.

Technology is a manifestation of human ingenuity. Its use and growth frees/ creates more time for us, so we can pursue a greater means. The fiat system implemented goes against our ingenuity and Darwinism. It promotes over consumption and distorts signal in the free market. 

Bad businesses should be wiped out under a capitalist system with hard money. For example, we need houses for people who need houses, not those who want to use it as a store of value (unreasonably). 
hi77x3s comment It's difficult to see what is actually good. Lots of contradictory information about what is healthy for humans. There are people living healthy who eat meat and also healthy people who don't. Same with sick people. Some eat meat, and some don't, and still they both suffer maladies, get old and die. 

A cow is probably happier than you are. It doesn't need to worry about looking good, paying bills, finding a non-crazy mate, inflation, and politics. It has a right to roam around and eat grass and preferably be taken out in least painful and quick manner in the end. Then we eat steak! No one should abuse animals for sick fun though. And I understand that the food industry is cruel as fuck. 
hi79lqa comment I expect to see your poll results published within 48 hours. You better be taking notes. 
hi7a14s comment I think there is something to this theory. I bet the percentage of vegans/AR people into bitcoin is higher that in general society. Bitcoiners and vegans have a lot in common, they both go against what everyone says they should be doing, both groups need to have a lot of inner strength to ignore the crowds and follow what they think is best. 
hi7jh1f comment Robert Breedlove is incredibly smart, if anyone wants to learn more about crypto and the money system in general go check out his YouTube channel. 

As for animals rights, I would imagine most people here dont care since they eat animals. My personal goal is to buy as much land with my bitcoin wealth as I can and restore animal habitats / protect it from future logging/mining/etc. 
hi7yx1r comment We shouldn’t kill animals indiscriminately and we should treat all animals with respect. I’m not against livestock farming and eating meat but things like battery farms and cruel treatment of any animals is inhumane. As a species we should be better at how we treat animals. 

Just because we have designated some animals for food and others for lab/research purposes, doesn’t mean we should be cruel or treat them without respect.

hi7gejj comment USD is a pyramid scheme. They don't even hide it. They put a pyramid right on their shitcoin. 
hi7dnj4 comment I think about that all the time. My theory is that the speculation will always outpace the reality. The speculation is fast, instant and dramatic. The reality, and the true purpose of bitcoin, is much slower in coming. But coming it is. We can point to more and more examples almost monthly. Businesses, people, countries… usage of bitcoin is increasing. But you’re right… without that actual usage… it’s ultimately pointless. But since we see the ever inching increase in usage… its a great thing to hold. Its day is coming… in my opinion. Speculators buy stocks valued at multiple times real world value or profits. They’ll use anything that makes them money… including BTC. But thats not BTC fault. Just keep looking for the real world adoptions. Thats what I watch. Its really helpful.

hi7ldkn comment tldr; Singer Mariah Carey has collaborated with the Winklevoss brothers’ cryptocurrency exchange Gemini to launch a campaign focused at empowering women around the world through cryptocurrency. Carey has over 10 million followers on the site and is using her influence to inspire more women to invest in the space. A percentage of trades completed by users who sign up using the singer’s code will be donated to a non-profit dedicated to women of colour in STEM fields.

Well good for her, offering free Bitcoin. I'll be sure to look up some of her material. 
qgo3fr submission Tesla May Reintroduce Bitcoin Payments 
hi7pjsd comment fuck elon 
hi7lddx comment tldr; Tesla CEO Elon Musk has stated that the company may restart transactions with cryptocurrencies in the future. Tesla invested $1.5 billion of its treasury in Bitcoin during the first quarter of the year. The company previously offered customers the opportunity to pay for electric vehicles using Bitcoin from January to March 2021.

hi7ndvl comment This is like Elon's own private ongoing China ban saga. 
hi89wfo comment Yawn. 
hi7u55s comment Fuck what you think 
qgo4q7 submission I know this is a cliché at this point, but we're still early. Here's why. 
hi7isxg comment No-coiners will never accept it because they are stubborn af. But most people are more open minded. 
hi8lh0z comment I was there in late 90s when Linux was the Bitcoin of its time. There are a number of similar dynamics. 

In 96-98 Microsoft (who actually coined the term FUD) would send shockwaves thru the nascent linux community by saying some Jamie Dimon-like thing....I had clients tell me to my face that: Linux is going to be sued out of existence and any company that tries to use it will also be sued...etc...etc. Exactly like now they could never answer: "Explain to me exactly how Microsoft is going to *sue linux*? (ie ban bitcoin)" 

Eventually the 800lb Gorilla IBM announced support for Linux in 99 followed closely by Oracle. Both of those were playing their own game -- which was keeping MS in check. But nonetheless that effectively changed the game and made people realize linux was here forever. 

The thing to remember is that as much as they *all* hate Bitcoin, they all hate each other even more....so Country A, although it doesn't like Bitcoin, will realize it can use it to undermine the power of Country B. Likewise Mastercard will do same to Visa, etc etc.

This is why Bitcoin can't be stopped *because* it has no leader, no spokesman, no corporate structure. 
hi8fj7m comment I like data. Data supports we are still early. Everything else is just noise. Numbers go up. Adoption will happen. People can choose to fight it or join it into realization. Many will try to spin it how it serves them along the way, but everyone owes it to themselves to study. 
hi7k8m4 comment Important to remember price is not the same as value. There are some short term liquidity issues in BTC (and all crypto) trading that means a single tweet from Elon can moon or red dildo the short term price.

But as we’ve seen with the China FUD and shit like this, it only takes a bit of time for BTC to resume finding its true value.

I agree we are early but mainly bc the adoption is still pretty minuscule. I don’t even think all of crypto has hit the 100m users number yet. Let that sink in. Facebook just reported almost 3 Billion users. And smartphone usage is twice that. So just using those as metrics, we are probably at the Facebook circa 2010 mark. Or the iPhone/smartphone 2007 mark.  I know BTC doesn’t create cash flow, but as an asset Apple shares have done about 40x since then and FB wasn’t even public then but probably a 20x increase in price.  So assuming BtC follows a similar track, I think the floor is a 20x in 10 years, but who knows with the cycles we have.  Bitcoin also has a use beyond a store of value/investment (payments, money transfer, etc.) 
hi80v21 comment The fact you believe BS like "Bitcoin down 20% as X happened" means we're still early.

If you think Jamie Dimon's proclaimed sentiment can affect price to the tune of 20%, you don't understand this market. 

Few things have any measurable effect. In the past: china fud, hashrate drops and Elon Musk. Now it would take the SEC or POTUS to announce a crackdown to see this kind of day-to-day moves. 
hi8u9tv comment >Dimon causing the price to drop and downward test 50k.

Never happened. Stop infering causality from mere poor correlations.

Bitcoin goes up or down 10% every 3 days. There is always news falsely establishing causation to any of the 20 events happened in those 3 days (always chosing the one that is most convenient for the article narrative, ofc). If it is not backed data and proper use of causal discovery methods: it is BS.

Remember when Musk made Bitcoin tank 50% in May? Well, probably never happened. Most likely it was miners from China selling before the mining ban was widespread.

Edit: I do not understand the downvotes.

Edit2: I do not say single events cannot move the price. I just say establishing causation is tough specially if no mechanism for the price move is known. 
hi89krr comment Why the hedge talk hey if anybody is reading this Buy Bitcoin get rich sell some of it buy realistate and land. 
hi9xuxn comment This is pure market manipulation plain and simple!! Kinda like the article in January where JPM said bitcoin wouldnt go over 40k again its gross and needs to stop 🤢🤢🤮🤮. 
hiajr4w comment How many times has JP Morgan been right as it relates to bitcoin? How many times wrong?

qgo7cs submission Inheritance 
hi7uvau comment If you are debt free put all of it in bitcoin. Buy half immediately and weekly increments of say $100, more if its down and less if its up.  Thats the "safe" cost averaging approach but really i would (and did) buy every bitcoin i could as soon as the money hit your account with your inheritance. Its only going up from here and it will be 80k by Thanksgiving. I bought 7k when he left me that in June i think the price was around 20k 
hi7i5zg comment Do NOT BUY ALL AT ONCE. Unless you catch bitcoin in a major dip, you'll be better off dollar cost averaging your money into bitcoin. That means, set aside maybe 50 or 100 dollars every week and buy each week regardless of the price with that 50 or 100 dollars. Over time, in theory, that will result in you earning MORE bitcoin with a LOWER average cost. 
hi8vg3t comment Open a Gemini.com account. Best exchange out there. Buy the 5k at one time to minimize fees. Set it and forget it. Look at it in 10 years. Don't hassle with cost averaging up. Will lose out on gains and pay more fees. This has never failed in the history of Bitcoin.  People on here will say otherwise because they don't have the cash on hand. They put in their $50 per pay check. Which is fine if that is ones only option. 
hi9ckix comment Not sure what advice you're looking for, have you looked into what bitcoin is and do you think it has a future? that is the real question. If you're buying bitcoin without really understanding what it is then you'll always be on edge and on the first big dump you'll sell at a big loss, happens all the time. 
hi7jth1 comment Not sure who said something about me being unhealthy lol I’m healthy now ,I am a 46 ye old healthy man ,Covid struck me hard that’s all 
hiawukm comment [removed] 
hi88wbm comment Definitely not debt free ,that’s why I wanna just use 5k of the amount I get ,I just wanna set something up that’s for sure 
hi9nklc comment Do not invest more than you can afford to lose. 
hi7ia04 comment Thank you .is that too much to invest ,or I should say ,should I put some into something else ? 
hi7tini comment Yep this good advice. I might tweak it slight and Dca in bigger chunks. Maybe 1000 or 2000 a week over 20 weeks should spread the risk enough.

hi8euqw comment Nice 
hi9evjk comment You awesome /u/ExtracurricularHerb 
hi9fpti comment Nice one! Will listen to this. 
qgohlo submission I thought we'd come further than this... 
hi7pmv5 comment Their logic is quite frankly, flawed.

Nobody is going to rob a bank if there's nothing in the vault. No cooperative of miners who put in time, money, and energy into mining bitcoin are going to sabotage the network they rely on to verify the blockchain. 

This is yet another attempt at financial institutions (via Bloomberg) trying to dissuade would-be retail investors from buying up the limited remaining supply, thus driving up the price. They, the institutional investors, want to keep prices as low as possible so they can buy more of it up for cheap. 
hi7jvyl comment further toward what? communism?  

you believe everything you read?  

how about you tell us why this is bad?  how about you tell us what it means about progress.  

you think bitcoin is "controlled"? is that really what you think? explain how my bitcoin is controlled by anyone but me. i dare you.  

when they say "controlled" they are literally suggesting that self-ownership is bad (and being rich is bad).    

of course whales control their bitcoin. it's theirs to control.  and of course wealth is concentrated. that's because very few people add value to this world. most people are worth negative value. like the author of this article for instance.   

further, having so-called "whale" addresses isn't the same thing as having all the wealth concentrated. whales are custodians for millions and millions of customers. and no amount of data analysis can reveal how many bitcoin owners are represented in the large bitcoin addresses. it's none of your business. so then why are you concerned?    

how does my wealth make you poor? am i not sharing it with you right now? 
hi7rvbh comment I feel like that whole sub is a bunch of dweebs mad that we make money without slaving for it. The hate of crypto is unreal there 
hic9l7s comment When you make money from bitcoin without slaving for it, where does that money actually come from? Doesn’t it just come out of the pockets of other people who slave for their money so they can save up and buy a little bit of bitcoin? 
hi7ofg9 comment Ah, I posted this to highlight how little most people still know about BTC. 
hi7lefy comment I have to complement this comment. Seriously, bravo. I got sick of spam email. I read the hashcash paper and was intrigued by Adam Back’s ideas. I continued to learn and fell down the Bitcoin hole. This isn’t about money as much as it’s about progress, ideas and evolution. Keep learning my friends, you’re future depends on it. 
Again, thank you for an awesome response 
hi8mhng comment >most people are worth negative value.

Damn, harsh. But I not gonna argue against it. 
hi7tlue comment It seems most of them don’t have a clue what BTC actually is these days. 
hi8z6rl comment That sub is to tech what r funny is to funny things. 
hi7xiry comment of course my friend. i am writing rhetorically and performative-ly (to steal a new age commie term) for everyone else but you and i.  oh i see, your title i misinterpreted. i get it. i'll leave my response anyway since i rather like it still. 
qgonpc submission Are there any books that talk about what goes on in the mind of an early investor? Any biographies from them? 
hi7wvu3 comment I haven’t read this, so can’t rate it, but it’s one that’s been on my radar for a while:

Bitcoin Billionaires: A True Story of Genius, Betrayal and Redemption https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1408711915/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_C14PYK8EAQR2936AN078 
hi86yf6 comment Around that time, we had this nice thing called e-gold. And this other nice thing called Liberty Reserve.  Neither were particularly intrusive about KYC, and indeed you could largely use both anonymously and go about your business.

Then US gov had to come along and ruin both of those things, because they were centralized, because they were vulnerable, and the US gov didn't like them.

Enter bitcoin, something they can't shut down, that doesn't enforce KYC/AML at the protocol level, and suddenly grown adults who just want to engage in voluntary trade with each other without interference by a third party can go about their business again.

In that context, after moving to bitcoin for those reasons, the price rise relative to fiat was just a happy side bonus, and absolutely nothing to do with the decision to move money into it. 
hi7l2r6 comment i see the idiotic part, but i don't see the wisdom. maybe you need a new name. 
hi920rg comment Thanks! I will check that out. 
qgop50 submission Best way to move crypto from am exchange? 
hi7lim6 comment Is the $20 a flat rate or something? That sounds like a really, REALLY high withdrawal fee. Check to see if they have some other way to withdraw. I know that with some exchanges (okcoin, for example), they require you to transfer funds from a funding account to a spending account and back again. Actually, its so confusing, I don't even use that exchange anymore.   
Maybe convert to dollars to withdraw from the exchange and reinvest on a different exchange?  
From the bittrex website, it says:  
"Bittrex does not charge fees for USD deposits and withdrawals. You will want to check with your bank as they may charge a fee to send your wire transfer as well as receive a wire transfer at your bank. Also, if your bank uses an intermediary bank, you will want to check with them to see if they charge a fee." 
hi7lkiy comment dude. there is only one way to move bitcoin. selling your bitcoin for shitcoins isn't moving your bitcoin. it's giving it to someone else.  

maybe you should have checked the fees BEFORE signing up for the service? 
hi7md77 comment Many exchanges have high fixed withdrawal fees  
https://withdrawalfees.com/coins/bitcoin  

Choose a different exchange. Some examples here:  
https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/g42ijd/faq_for_beginners/ 
hi8uuoo comment Keep it on the exchange. Not worth taking it off until it reaches a few thousand minimal. 
hi8wu0w comment What are your plans with those 50 bucks after the withdrawal? LMAO... Play them with 100x leverage, you might actually get lucky... 
hi7m65t comment My intention is to see if anyone has advice for a better coin to withdraw. That is supposedly the mining fee for Bitcoin according to Bittrex. It is ridiculous and I have no intention of using that exchange anymore. According to their own support it isn't their fee though. USDC fails to withdraw. They recommended buying more USDC. I want to see if there's a better way because I don't want to just guess at it. 
hi7ltxw comment My intention was to move it to my cold wallet and then convert it back to Bitcoin from there. It's a new wallet and I'm moving all funds to it. There must be a coin I can move out that would have less fees for the transfer. 
hi7mhq4 comment I have a cold wallet now that uses ledger live. It would be easy to convert in there but it's a matter of moving all the funds first. Looking for the best way to pull it off. 
hib9kfv comment Moving all assets to my cold wallet. $50 isn't my total investment... Just what I had left in that particular exchange

qgphfk submission Roughly 50 miners (approximately 0.1% of the network) command 50% of the Bitcoin network’s total hashing power? 
hi7v0y8 comment Essentially things like these break it down into pool control by country. So if you took all the pools controlled by Chinese interest and say the Chinese government took control of the pools they could mess with Bitcoin. This would be noticeable on the system and exchanges would turn off trading. What they can't do is reverse old transactions or create new blocks. So the damage would literally be whatever was traded within the 10-20 minute period it took the network to notice and those pools to switch into other pools (large mining operations have this coded to happen automatically and the switch takes seconds). So the only one capable of doing it would be a large government and the global repercussions would far out risk the gain.

The tax rate in Germany is linearly progressive and the higher the income, the steeper the slope of the tax rate.

you can absolutely connect your hw wallet with electrum and [sweep your keys into it](https://bitcoinelectrum.com/sweeping-your-private-keys-into-electrum/). I think you might be mistaking sweeping a pk with importing it. 
qgq5w3 submission South Korean pension fund to invest in Bitcoin ETF: Report 
hi7uce9 comment tldr; South Korea’s public pension fund, the Korean Teachers’ Credit Union (KTCU), is reportedly looking to gain exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) via a crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF). KTCU is one of the largest institutional investors in South Korea, with $40.2 billion in assets under management.

The world faces “strong inflationary pressure” in the short term, and it may persist, he said in a Twitter debate with Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood and MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor. With over $250 billion in net assets, potential exposure to devaluating currencies is more of a potential problem than ever.

qgqhqj submission Passphrase protected account on Trezor and future recovery. 
hi7vwzz comment > If I were to recover my BTC to a new trezor or any other wallet with my seed would both my accounts show up? And if so would I still need the passphrase to access the second( hidden) wallet?   

Recovering **with** the passphrase will only show the wallet which you created with the passphrase. Recovering **without** the passphrase will only show the other wallet. Both wallets are different from each other and completely independent. 
hi7vw1z comment > If I were to recover my BTC to a new trezor or any other wallet with my seed would both my accounts show up? And if so would I still need the passphrase to access the second( hidden) wallet?

They would both still be there and you'd still need the passphrase for the protected account.

> I am wondering how the seed can code for what appears to be two addresses on my wallet and where the passphrase fits into wallet recovery.

The passphrase extends the seed - so you basically have two different seeds. 
hi7wdzp comment I see.  I didn’t think that a passphrase would be transferable. Is there an option on new hardware wallets to recover the wallet with a passphrase? Or is it a complicated process? 
hi7wgkf comment Thank you I understand now. The extension to the seed makes sense.
Much appreciated 
hi7wkv1 comment > Is there an option on new hardware wallets to recover the wallet with a passphrase? Or is it a complicated process?

It shouldn't be complicated but it depends on the hardware wallet, I guess.  

>  I didn’t think that a passphrase would be transferable.  

You can think of it as a 25th word (not really technically correct though), essentially it's like creating a whole new seed. It's not bound to your specific device on which you generated it, just like the regular 24 words seed is not bound to it. Don't confuse it with a device-specific PIN or something like that :) 
hi7wrhg comment Thanks for the explanation. Got it.

hi7yrcs comment tldr; Bitcoin is still trading above the US $ 60,000 mark for the first time since October 15. On-chain data also shows that Bitcoin continues to have steam on the kettle. The MVRV Z-Score, for example, is just under 4, which is far below an overheated level. Bitcoin's market cap is expected to surpass gold's then market cap of $7.5 trillion.

hi8gj0g comment I bring it up once and if they aren’t interested I let it go.  You can’t idea-rape people 
hi88a9m comment I have to disagree.

If anyone is genuinely curious then the resources are available to them and there’s no shortage of “bitcoiners” willing to engage in good faith.

When we start to put ourselves out there, that’s when you attract the vipers; those that argue not in good faith but out of fear, those that haven’t gotten wealthy and don’t want you to get wealthy either, or those that are just happy with the status quo. 

I’m getting sick of the number of people I engage with here on Reddit that argue in bad faith. Why are we even arguing? This should be an open discussion. Not to mention the number of redditors that just delete their comments and/or accounts when they realise that they’re arguing poorly. It gets exhausting repeating.

We’ve had 12 years of bitcoin now. They’ve had their chance to become early-adopters. 
hi7wy80 comment So get in there and argue. Provide counterpoints and education.

hi83lbt comment I know it’s annoying, but when you think about it, it’s logical. These are tech people and probably would have been around when btc was first created or at least very cheap. They rightly feel they missed a trick that they should have seen. That makes them reflect badly on themselves and might even be embarrassing. That’s hard to take. (I know it’s early still and they could still participate etc, but they won’t see it that way) just human nature. It would be easier to convince people in /r/religion or /r/flatworld 
hi8j0uq comment People need to understand how today financial system works first. How fiat currency works. The history or currency. Once they learn that and realize how fuckes it all is they will want to see an alternative. That is when they need to fall into the bitcoin rabbit hole. 

That’s how I approach it. I tell people about fiat currency and how it works today. Then get into bitcoin.  People who try to downplay bitcoin or act like it’s nothing, will realize how dumb it sounds when they understand fiat currency. 
hi8s1hd comment Most of us know that when the pitchforks are already out it's pointless. Reddit revolves around creating small echo chambers, where opposing opinions are downvoted and censored to oblivion. You would never change any minds in a thread like that.

hi80409 comment I’ve wasted a lot of time trying to articulate reality in r/Technology. Those idiots have their minds made up (mostly). It’s popular to not like bitcoin there.

I will have my position in bitcoin and be a decade ahead of those clowns as their fiat savings melt at an accelerated rate. It’s going to be a tough lesson for many but it’s their own fault. 
qgqpfv submission Easy way to keep seed secret? 
hi7ydow comment Use a [passphrase](https://www.blockplate.com/blogs/blockplate/what-is-a-bip39-passphrase ) instead.

It will create a brand new wallet where you need both your seed and a passphrase to access your funds.

If you’re interested in more seed security topics check out /r/seedstorage 
hi7yvm0 comment Or you can use a passphrase like "twelve seventeen" and store it at a different location than the seed words. **NOT just in your head, please.** Always backup. And then, backup the backup.

hi8acwb comment Trying all the permutations if you know all the words are super fast. So no, that's a terrible idea. It's better to add a passphrase that you do not store with your seed.

It will not invest directly in BTC, but will instead maintain managed short exposure position contracts issued by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The fund may invest in other BTC futures, money market funds, deposit accounts and short-term debt instruments.

they aren't forging bitcoin. real bitcoin can't be faked. if it could, then wtf use is bitcoin anyway?  

do you remember what makes bitcoin good and useful? because if those things are really good and useful, then those things will be purchased and used. other people buying stupid shit is a constant in the world. stupid people are the norm. so don't be stupid. 
hi8vb4m comment I'd consider all altcoins fake Bitcoin. So a little over a $Trillion. All that time and resource could be pushing btc along but people would rather gamble and get scammed. 
hi8559m comment The only fake one is BITO.  
GBTC and real ETFs coming in the future have real BTC (audited) in their wallets. It's just not your keys, so by buying shares you only have an IOU.  
The same with robinhood, paypal, ... If someone buys there, they buy it from the market and hold it for you. Not buying is just gambling, and you don't become big if you gamble. Effectively they would then perma-short BTC and that is just stupid (shorting, because not buying BTC when the customer pays for it is the same as borrowing from him and selling it) 
hi854x2 comment GBTC is asking you to trust them they have the BTC.

The fundamental of BTC philosophy is "don't trust, verify"

Ergo GBTC is not real BTC

DYOR 
hi978ep comment gbtc is real bitcoin, but how do you know you have real gbtc? the nesting doll custodian relationships make it impossible to know. Ultimately you're just facing some broker who says you have gbtc.. but if they go under it may turn out that wasn't the case. It might infact be the case that 10x as many people think they own gbtc as gbtc exists or btc backing it.

hi8aa0v comment tldr; Researchers have found that 11,043 entities are responsible for 55% of Bitcoin’s on-chain volume. Cryptocurrency exchanges were estimated to account for three-quarters of the volume. The report also found that one-tenth of all Bitcoin miners control 90% of the network hash rate. However, individual Bitcoin holders currently represent 45% of supply.
