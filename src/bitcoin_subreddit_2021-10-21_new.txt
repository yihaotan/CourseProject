qceuqw submission coinbase taxes - capital gains 
hhfj1kb comment You will owe capital gains tax on gains. 
hhfjkgb comment Yes you do. You must record and report each sale and calculate gain on it and taxes due. The dca people buying often will have a harder time figuring out cost basis. See IRS.gov 
hhfjo9m comment in australia and countries with similar tax laws, like us, nz, england every sale of goods is a taxable event, so yes

i believe it is up to you which coins you sell, example.. if you have had 1 bitcoin for over a year and bought one recently, then selll one now, you can choose to sell the one from a year ago and pay less tax (long term cgt). or if you made less profit on the one you bought recently you can choose to sell that one. it is up to you or your accountant to sort this out as it may not be automaticly chosen this way.

i could be wrong, but hope this helps you find answer you need. 
hhg403o comment In germany you dont pay tax on crypto you did hodl 1 year + 
hhfjse0 comment Check what the exempt threshold/tax free allowance is wherever you are (if there is one). 
hhfkjlu comment Yes, The only way you don't pay taxes as if you don't have gaines or you have losses. Whether it be first in first out or last in first out method for orders you're still looking at gaines. The only difference would be how much tax, short-term or long  term capital gains. Take a look at cointracker or there are some other crypto tax software programs that will make it easier.  Most of them will cost money or you can pay some CPAs to do it which is what I do but you're not going to be able to avoid taxes legally. Assuming it's long-term you're looking at 0, 15% or 20% depending on your income, or it's your tax bracket % if you're selling short-term. Be sure to set that amount aside for tax season 
hhfmzzs comment It depends on your country and citizenship. Each one has different rules.

But in general, you can use FIFO (First In, First Out), and some countries give you discounts if you've held for more than a year. 
hhibjhk comment Talk to a cpa or tax attorney, you will need to keep track of your basis on your own 
hhjg1cl comment Use something like taxbit, they will calculate for you and you can use last in first out or whatever makes the most sense. Keep in mind you should use the same method year over year or keep track of it moving forward.

qcfjkr submission Scenario: US makes Bitcoin its only official currency. What would happen? 
hhfof0o comment What happens is you choke Riley Reid to death with your 16 inch Kirk, because that‚Äôs an equally likely scenario 
hhfnxmi comment All the old corrupt politicians would despair because they no longer know how money works. 
hhfoa0k comment The government would fall apart.  They dont have bitcoin currently and cannot print any like they would with the dollar.  They immediately would not be able to pay for the military, social security, medicare, etc.  

Any government that wants to switch to bitcoin would need a transition period where they first accumulate bitcoin through taxes for a few years.  Once they have accumulated enough, then they could possibly make the switch. 
hhfnytu comment Question is what happened prior to cause such an insane upheaval of the fed bank to take place 
hhfo3g5 comment Legal tender or currency?

I'm not sure if a government can make Bitcoin their currency, since it cannot control the supply of it.

We're seeing in real time the effects of making Bitcoin legal tender.

We'll see what happens in El Salvador. Also, since 2021, you can pay for your taxes with Bitcoin in Zug, Switzerland.

The Bitcoin Standard book is a great read if you're interested in this. 
hhfqdmy comment Well, one person can‚Äôt make that decision in the USA.  

You‚Äôd need a supermajority of politicians to basically vote to destroy and bankrupt the entire country. 
hhfvoe5 comment The majority of cities have been burning for over a year. The military has been defeated and small clans of humans survive by scavenging the Old World‚Äôs garbage dumps. All stores have long since been raided for anything valuable and remain empty and boarded up. Bitcoin is named the ‚Äúofficial US currency‚Äù by a few remaining homeless men standing around a trash can fire. All is dust. 

Pretty much how I see it happening. Afterwards would just be more of the same dystopian decline. 
hhfwlyi comment They never will because they're drunk on money printing 
hhfwzuk comment It‚Äôs more likely to become a reserve asset. 
hhg0abv comment 
The lawful money of the United States is defined in law at 1 US 246. Bitcoin cannot be real United States money without Congressional action here.

qcfmwr submission Is BTC a Trap Created by the Wealthy Elite? 
hhfpn4i comment > No one really knows who Satoshi is

Well, of course at least one person knows. It was at least one person who for a period of time, around a year or so, was releasing the Bitcoin source code, and posting comments in public forums and emails before dissappearing.

> how do we know BTC wasn't created by a small percentage of the wealthy elite in order to force digital currency on us, meanwhile scooping up all the sats in the process?

If you read the origins of Bitcoin(2009-2010ish), you'll realize the probability this hypothesis is correct is basically zero. Bitcoin was pretty much ignored for about a year or so, only a few people interacted with it. It was also released as open source, and it was free to get bitcoins in the beginning.

Also, the ideas behind the creation of Bitcoin were against the interest of the wealthy. The 2008 collapse of the banks and the bail-outs were a catalyst for its creation.

It might seem rare, but Bitcoin was not created for generating wealth for the creator. Open source is a magical thing, it works very differently compared to the rest of the society. 
hhfojbd comment The wealthy elite already have the system rigged‚Ä¶ This is the small guys chance. 
hhfoggr comment [deleted] 
hhfp32s comment It literally wouldn‚Äôt make any difference if that were true lol

Only a relatively small amount of the current ‚Äúwealthy elite‚Äù will have a BTC balance that reflects their other wealth, and conversely there are many people that aren‚Äôt traditionally wealthy that have been made wealthy due to Bitcoin. That is true regardless of the origin of Bitcoin. 
hhfshcj comment A trap is only a trap if you can‚Äôt verify that it is not a trap. Bitcoin is open source and you can self validate everything. What‚Äôs part of it is a trap? 
hhfp9q7 comment i was saying to a mate a couple of months back, "what if satoshi was made up by the big banks when they were thinking of new ways to take money from people, they would have to convince those people that cashing out was the worst thing they could do which makes their total stated wealth irrelevant assuming that the majority only ever withdrew what they needed. then one fine day it all just dissappears with a 'we told ya so' " 
hhfso1b comment Because it was made in the open by a group of known crypto anarchists on a public mailing list. 
hhftr7y comment No because the wealthy elite do not want to see their traditional investments threatened by the blackhole that is bitcoin. Bitcoin is inevitable. 
hhfv57r comment There was no pre-mines coins in bitcoin. Satoshi basically started the same mining process just like any other who was interested in bitcoin back then (not many). It all started as an experiment and they didn‚Äôt even have a price in USD until later. So your concern that it was created to benefit the elite can‚Äôt be right. There are some ppl got very wealthy by diving in early but they also assumed a lot more risk than we do today so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unfair. The key was that satoshi was careful and deliberately made the initial phase as fair as possible ‚Äî no premined, announce bitcoin and shared source code days before going live, IIRC he also ditched the very first 50BTC from the genesis block just so there was absolutely no hint of an unfair start. Now compared that to other shitcoins‚Ä¶ difference is night and day

hhfrr8t comment Handies and blowies in the alley for cash. The fuck do you think? 
hhft376 comment You do like rich people. You get a loan against your assets (Bitcoin) but you never sell. You assume your assets will appreciate (in the long term) more than the APY (%) of your loan. 

Bonus: you don't pay any taxes since getting a loan is tax free.

How do you paid the loan? Once the term ends you get a bigger loan to pay the original one and to get more cash. Your assets are now worth more, so that is ok 
hhglu7k comment Borrow against it as collateral. You can use Nexo, Celsius, etc 
hhfrw4d comment You're only literally living on bitcoin if you have nothing else at all. Your line of thought is correct. It's cheaper to pay off a 3% mortgage over 30 years than it is to sacrifice a bitcoin half way through to pay the remainder. As long as fiat inflates and bitcoin deflates you're better off spending your cash asap and just using bitcoin as a savings account.

hhfxrtm comment Bitcoin reached a high of 66,999 today as an all time high 


69. Lol niceeee 
hhfyhku comment Who cares. Stack sats 
qch02y submission The price is important in only two ways 
hhhkjhz comment There's another reason the price is important: it attracts miners, which increases the security of the network. 
hhfy1a6 comment It‚Äôs unfortunate that so many people are so anti-BTC. So what if it‚Äôs super slow and massive energy required. It‚Äôs cool so F those guys. 
hhhm3x6 comment Great point, so there are actually 3 ways the price is important haha 
hhg3rfg comment > It's super slow

Layer 1 is generally for "larger" transactions. These take 6 blocks to **settle** which is very different to "transact". e.g. a fiat transaction using Visa can take up to 30 days to actually settle.

But even then one can use it for small, fast transactions. I mean, if you were selling a (cliche) coffee would you accept zero confirmation transactions? Probably; it's very low risk and very low consequences. And a zero confirmation transaction takes a second or two.

Also fees are still around 1 sat/byte! (who needed big blocks after all?)

I just can't see the scenario where **settling** a 5btc transaction in an hour for the equivalent of a few cents is "slow".

And as i explained zero conf. txs are fine for a coffee, really.

And then there is the **Lightning Network**. Instant transactions, super minimal fees (negative fee is possible), TOR-like privacy, infinite scaling. What more can you ask for? Seriously.

Bitcoin is most definitely not slow. I can't believe people still claim this. 
hhg7ybk comment Yeah I completely agree with you, it‚Äôs super slow but still really cool. Who cares it can‚Äôt do instant settlement like other ISO tokens. 
hhhkej5 comment The 10 minute onchain settlement on the bitcoin network has more security behind it than other tokens do after hundreds of confirmations.

If you want instant settlement, you can use the lightning network, as well as other layer two or layer 3 networks that are in development, that have different security/speed/usability tradeoffs than on-chain transactions. 
hhjm91n comment Yea it‚Äôs definitely older tech, I agree. BTC is going to be phased out over the next few years as better tech comes online but it‚Äôs def cool for now. Buy low sell high!

hhg0gf0 comment Right now it‚Äôs very easy, you buy it and be patient. It‚Äôs going up every day so‚Ä¶ the more you buy, the more you‚Äôre going to make. 
hhg2k9l comment Don't waste your time. Buy some hold it for 5 years. Sell. 
hhg50ms comment Bitcoin is money, people are fleeing inflation 
hhg1kvl comment If you are still stuck in the "I NEED TO MAKE MONEY" stage of your life..

hhg10l2 comment RIP your messages from scammers üòÇ 
hhg14n5 comment make money? bitcoin is money. it's not complicated. just buy it. 
hhg05kr comment It‚Äôs as easy as anything else. Just buy some and wait until it‚Äôs worth more‚Ä¶ which usually happens pretty quick. 

I think the main difference you‚Äôll find in crypto vs traditional stocks is the volatility. You could be waiting a year to see 10% movement in a stock. Bitcoin can go up 20% and back down 10% in the same day. In a good way. 
hhgmf9c comment Step 1: buy Bitcoin

Step 2: be patient

hhgco2w comment Have you tested the Btcpayserver virtual IP/clearnet feature ?

Ie: if we run a Tor Umbrel/mynodebtc Btcpayserver store then it is presumably only available to Tor customers.

I think Raspiblitz has some feature or server to allow clearnet access ? 
hhg7jzp comment tldr; RaspiBlitz has added support for Blockstream‚Äôs c-lightning implementation. Users can now choose between running only LND, running only c-Lightning, or running both at the same time. Lightning Labs‚Äô implementation is more reliable for routing payments on the first try, and benefits from more third party applications.

hhgbxu0 comment They have to unban it so they can ban it again 
hhgdxz9 comment The CCP party got a lot of stake in it. They just want their bags to go up using bullish news pressure. They have no intention to seek public opinion. 
hhg81n1 comment China is the Friday The 13th movie series  of BTC 
hhgmfbb comment [deleted] 
hhgi2mm comment Is it because of the successful BTC Futures ETF?  Or maybe it‚Äôs because the US is making positive headlines so they singled themselves out from the huge potential and innovation coming in like a tsunami?  I especially love how one headline said there is now 0% hash rate coming from China lol! 
hhg7jpe comment tldr; China‚Äôs National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) recently published a report soliciting opinions from the public. The NDRC refers to the recently banned digital currency mining industries and asks Chinese citizens to opine on the matter. This comes after China first banned financial institutions and payment companies from providing crypto-based services.

*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.* 
hhgkk5x comment Nope, China is not allowed to Bitcoin anymore. We've banned them. Bitcoin banned China.

qchub9 submission My Bank Won't Let Me Buy a Hardware Wallet 
hhga7lb comment I suspect it‚Äôs cause your were buying from the official Trezor store and it‚Äôs in a foreign country. 
hhh3qng comment This has nothing to do with bitcoin versus the dollar, this is for your protection in case your credit card info is stolen and someone tries to use it in a foreign country. If you had bought it from a retailer in your country there wouldn't be any issues. 
hhg7d0y comment Thanks for sharing! Mind telling us which bank? Seems weird that they won‚Äôt even let you buy a hardware wallet, which is just a USB electronic device. 
qchvym submission Bitcoin = getting rid of cash?? Is that a good thing? 
hhg4r9e comment Put down the weed pipe 
hhg4jtz comment I would encourage you to read about Bitcoin. Your paper money becomes worth less each day. Mine grows. Bitcoin is not a scam. It can be traced but cannot be stopped if your never disclose your wallet number. You can also use VPN‚Äôs if you are so concerned about tracing.


Also, Bitcoin is not a conspiracy to kill the Bank of England. It‚Äôs a conspiracy to kill fiat currency and the US dollar. No small fish. 
hhg9ue9 comment If it‚Äôs value was backed by Bitcoin it may be good to have but unfortunately it‚Äôs not backed by anything and loses value daily. 
hhg7euo comment Cashless society has always been the goal. 
hhgestj comment I don‚Äôt hate this argument, solely from a traceability/illegal purchase perspective. 

I hate it for every other reason though. 

Cash is a sort of freedom, if you think about it. I‚Äôd like to reiterate, my mindset is 99% pro btc versus 1% usd. 
hhgbgnc comment Yes, you‚Äôre correct. Cash is continually devalued but far easier to have on hand and use as needed. BTC will always be seen as valuable to the people holding it. 
hhggo1s comment Taproot and the lightning network are making bitcoin more private. The protocol will likely continue to be improved from a privacy standpoint into the future with BIP‚Äôs and side chains. The fixes and refinements exist they just have to be expanded upon, which always takes time. 

Also, bitcoin is transparent in that it‚Äôs a public ledger but it‚Äôs pseudonymous as a baseline and can be made anonymous with effort. And bitcoin is permissionless. It‚Äôs possible with some concerted effort to surveil transactions retroactively but they can‚Äôt ever be stopped or accessed. 
hhgpg07 comment cash is very traceable, and bitcoin can be very untraceable. it‚Äôs pseudo-anonymity is more powerful than you give it credit for; anonymous/local peer-to-peer paper wallet transactions for example, and layer 2s that will provide some form of coin mixing. regardless, cash is not going anywhere, bitcoin is a great complement to an inflationary asset because it‚Äôs finite supply and lost coins make it basically deflationary 
hhgwk1r comment With cash, you need electricity. 

Banks needs electricity for cash. Banks require electricity for heat (sometimes, although sometimes gas), lighting,  security, server rooms, computers. 

Businesses need electricity for computers and cash registers.

Cash definitely needs electricity.

Isn't most money done electronically over debit or credit purchases?

Electricity is needed to print money.

I actually think cash uses more electricity than Bitcoin 
hhh9tox comment > Is bitcoin to get rid of cash?

No, read this  
https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf

> Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non-reversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party

Use cash for meatworld transactions. Cash is impractical for on-line transactions. Using Bitcoin for on-line transactions is analogous to using cash for meatworld transactions

qci0t7 submission Crypto Lending question 
hhg5ry2 comment good question and very well written article.

my guess is like traditional financial institutions, there are hedges in place, eg futures and options, and/or insurance to protect from price volatility. 
hhg5rtx comment This is a great question, I hope someone with applicable knowledge will answer. I'm under the impression lending my btc is a bad idea regardless of potential gains though, because you would have to give up control over it to lend...and we all know, not your keys, not your crypto. I don't want to lose my little bit of value in this space to a system that doesn't allow for retention of control in the first place. Please explain this as well if you understand it!! 
hhgm08a comment This example is a little bit misleading. You simplified such a platform to a case when someone borrows USD(T) and another person lends BTC. 
By adjusting interest rates (for borrowing amd lending) you have nearly a match between lending and borrowing positions per currency so that the platform isn't at risk. 
hhgcvb9 comment Thanks. If they have the money to buy futures and options, they could as well use it to fund the borrower's capital right? Why involve lenders? 
hhgrp53 comment use hedges to offset net risk, not gross risk. so its a fraction of the total risk.

qcj9wm submission Could someone make a price tracker account similar to @BitcoinStimulus but for the Salvadorians? 
hhgcwn2 comment why would a price tracker help salvadorans trust their government? or bitcoin for that matter?  

how about you just reply with arguments why they shouldn't worry about their govt's intentions since bitcoin gives the power usually reserved only for the government back to the people?  it's like complaining about the emancipation proclamation as a slave, just because it came from govt. while it's true govt enslaves everyone by its mere existence, less slavery is better than more slavery. at least unless you are a slave master. 
hhgdfpl comment The free $30 in Bitcoin on 7 September 2021 was about 0.00057 BTC.

That's about $37 today.

You can get that value from [this link](https://coinmarketcap.com/converter/btc/usd/?amt=0.00057), or any api to convert it.

But you don't need to trust any government to use Bitcoin. That's one of the great things about it. 
hhgei32 comment The ChivoWallet was provided by the government and when the citizens make an account they recibe $30 worth of Bitcoin. A lot people distrust the government and now they distrust Bitcoin for association. Which is ironic and kind of stupid but anyway. 

I just think the price tracker could be a good incentive to increase the adoption. 
qcjclr submission In a few halvings, the block reward starts to become so insignificant that mining no longer becomes profitable. Bitcoin MUST have global mass adoption, or else the incentive structure fails. 
hhgd0hw comment You‚Äôre forgetting that the value of BTC would have also risen, and the smaller amount of BTC awarded would still be a very high value.

Edit to add thoughts:
Also BTC becoming the currency ‚Äúof the world‚Äù where governments change their strategies based on BTC - is never going to happen. For an entire novel worth of reasons‚Ä¶

hhgjfob comment Bitbox, easy and secure 
hhgdunn comment +1 for Trezor or Ledger. I prefer Trezor as it‚Äôs fully
Open source, but the $69 (nice) One won‚Äôt work for you if you want to work with a lot of altcoins - you‚Äôd need the Trezor T for $200. However, at that price it‚Äôs hard for me to recommend over the Ledger Nano S for $59. That‚Äôs what it comes down to for me - if you want to manage altcoins go with a Ledger Nano S, and if not go with the Trezor One.

~14 Million USD/BTC will surpass dollars in broad terms, though that's an absurd measurement since presumably dollars would either cease to exist or be hyperinflated into oblivion if bitcoin ever got close to that, rendering the comparison irrelevant or so distorted as to be meaningless to speculate. 
hhgx1we comment LOL. SILVER = PHYSICAL SILVER 1% + 99% PAPER SILVER - this is ratio behind name SILVER. Just look at daily volume of trade.

[https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/metals/precious/silver.volume.html](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/metals/precious/silver.volume.html)

Each unit is 5000oz! 100K is 2/3 of global mining production , traded in 1 day. This much is required to suppress price of physical metal with paper derivatives.

There is around 98m physical silver registered for sale on Comex market today at 24$ = 2.4bln $ .. 2.4$ BLN $ is absolute peanuts. That little is required to drain physical metal => make paper derivatives worthless =>free up price of silver=> cause domino effect on gold => Hit FED hard!

You BTC fans are yet to experience goodness of ETF and futures market. 
hhgjedc comment Interesting 
hhih4wb comment experience? why would anyone buy futures when they can buy spot? there's no need for futures in bitcoin. there is a need for futures with metals. custody and delivery are the cause of futures shenanigans. but custody and delivery are not an issue with bitcoin. you gold bugs are yet to experience bitcoin's goodness.

hhggrgd comment >I‚Äôm 100% in alt-coins...I‚Äôm not sure how heavy to go into BTC  

>I want some exposure to BTC in my portfolio since it has so much adoption and it dominates  

then it should dominate your portfolio unless you're a gambler, no? how are we supposed to know your risk appetite? bitcoin is money, which is the foundation of a peaceful and prosperous society. shitcoins are play things. basically they're all nfts compared to bitcoin. it's such a vast gap that they are difficult to compare. 
hhgklkc comment Alts are off topic.

You're only 16. 

Buy and continue to DCA accumulate  bitcoin amd HODL for at least 5 years.

Almost every altcoin from 5 years ago has disappeared to zero.
