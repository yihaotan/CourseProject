hj996df comment Cannot believe that the court case started this month 1/11/21 claims that this guy is the original satoshi and he is threatening to basically devalue BTC in favour of his clone fork (BSV) which claims to be 'purer' to the original intent of the whitepapers. If he had the ability to move the BTC he would have done it well before now, lol 
hh1xv1p comment Wow. I knew that conman was fraud and a professional scam artist, but I had no idea of the vast extent of his scams. 
hh25z9i comment tldr; Australian Satoshi Nakamoto cosplayer Craig Wright started using Bitcoin as a scam tool in 2013 when he bought his first few Bitcoin on Mt Gox in April 2013. His Bitcoin affinity fraud project BSV (sometimes called ‚ÄúBankrupt Soon Vehicle‚Äù already) will very likely not escape the hand of doom that follows Craig closely since he started his Bitcoin fraud show in 2013. The Australian authorities said the raids were part of a tax investigation.

hh3bjdq comment Your comment contains the answer: narcissistic personality disorder.

"**Lives in a fantasy world that supports their delusions of grandeur** 

Since reality doesn‚Äôt support their grandiose view of themselves, narcissists live in a fantasy world propped up by distortion, self-deception, and magical thinking. They spin self-glorifying fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, attractiveness, and ideal love that make them feel special and in control. These fantasies protect them from feelings of inner emptiness and shame, so facts and opinions that contradict them are ignored or rationalized away. Anything that threatens to burst the fantasy bubble is met with extreme defensiveness and even rage, so those around the narcissist learn to tread carefully around their denial of reality."

qabe5r submission SEC Greenlights ProShares Bitcoin Futures ETF, BTC Price Nears ATH 
hh21b8g comment **These future ETFs are a shitshow**. SEC knows if they approved an *asset-backed quality bitcoin etf*, bitcoin would soar like hell bringing bitcoin to $200k-$400k in a matter of weeks. 

And as you can certainly imagine there are some reasons this is not wanted:

**1) Banksters haven't yet accumulated enough**

**2) Too many unknown whales outthere**

**3) Way too many retail investors with way too much wealth in the end.**


The products getting approval now **have nothing to do with actual bitcoins**. On top they come with heavy [downsides](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/q4hpcy/z/hg0jm11)  I strongly recommend to look into. In fact to me it's quite obvious. Their sole purpose of being created and sold is keeping the crowd as far as possible away from **the actual investment of the millennium, Bitcoin itself**. And while everybody institutional is busy overcoming the remaining hurdles and getting into this derivate shit for their average Joe customers, in the background the privileged quietly and secretly keep stacking actual Bitcoin for highly undervalued prices. Until their greed is satisfied (which will never be) and the future etf bubble of hope pops as well, revealing bitcoins true price in some years. Which will be a lot higher then they'll in between pretend it to be.

This is why I won't stop calling them out. They won't get away with this. They won't fool millions of people out of real bitcoin into some cowshitvalued investment piece of crap. Remember my words. Fiat money's time is running out. And all of these fraudy banksters will fuckin go down with it. Remember my words.

hh1xz9d comment Your submission has been flagged for removal because it pertains to an incompatible derivative of Bitcoin commonly referred to as Bcash (BCH/BCC), or ‚ÄòBitcoin Cash‚Äô. Prior to August 1st 2017, Bcash did not exist *(see:* [*‚ÄúBitcoin Cash Veers Off at Block Height 478558‚Äù*](https://archive.is/fCbpa)*)*. A small segment of miners decided to create an incompatible set of consensus rules based on Bitcoin‚Äôs existing network, and at block heigh 478559, Bcash was born. This method of copying an existing blockchain with no consensus among the existing network is commonly referred to as an airdrop. The Bcash token has become problematic primarily due to fraudulent marketing practices portraying Bcash as if it were Bitcoin. But since Bcash is an merely impostor of Bitcoin, it really doesn‚Äôt belong in the Bitcoin subreddit. Therefore the r/Bitcoin mod team (and readers) kindly ask you to post in a Bcash-oriented subreddit instead. Despite its misleading name, the r/btc subreddit prides itself on welcoming all Bcash-related material (while ironically being anti-Bitcoin at the same time). Other subreddits which welcome Bcash-related material include r/bcash and r/bitcoincash. If you require assistance in claiming the Bcash airdrop or others, we recommend posting this to the r/BitcoinAirdrops subreddit for more info. Thank you.

let's say the growth is 700% in the last 6 years and 481% in the last 12 months and so on. So it looks like an exponential curve, but I need to find the exponent formula for this.

What would the predicted Bitcoin value be by the end of this year? That's assuming that it follows the same curve.

Then once the exponent is known, how do you apply it to the starting value? Is this like a compounding interest except the rate keeps increasing over time? Any help would be appreciated.

hh2pj41 comment > Is this like a compounding interest except the rate keeps increasing over time?

Exponents are just steady growth through time. The compounding is the exponent, no need for the rate to increase.

You're probably looking for a curve other than exponential though.

Has the SEC only approved them to roll futures contracts, or hypothetically could the ETF let a contract expire and end up owning the underlying?

hh7lf8c comment Okay, so this cycle we go up to 200k+ then back down to 61k next year then double every year till next halving then 1millie then back down 420k...got it. 
hh2obt8 comment "every year" is a phrase you're using creatively.  

now release these same statistics in real terms, aka adjusted for inflation. 
hh2k1m7 comment Benjamin Cowen is measuring from scamwick low to scamwick high. Volatility is decreasing, so of course that model that measures scamwicks shows diminishing returns.

Ben is observing decreasing volatility and is confusing it with decreasing performance.

I'm saying that if you bought Bitcoin in 2011 for 30 dollars and held, you would have seen a 2x every single year you held.

Bitcoin actually traded at these prices in each of these respective years (except 2012):

$30 = 2011

30 x 2 = $60 = 2012

60 x 2 = $120 = 2013

120 x 2 =  $240 = 2014

240 x 2 = $480 = 2015

480 x 2 = $960 = 2016

960 x 2 = $1920 = 2017

1920 x 2 = $3840 = 2018

3840 x 2 = $7680 = 2019

7680 x 2 = $15360 = 2020

15360 x 2 = $30720 = 2021

he is NOT a businessman, and even he would admit that. he's just a salesman, selling dreams for leftists and technocrats.  his scientific cred is laughable. real scientists don't take his claims seriously. only politicians, eco-tards, and kids do.

Mining helps heat my home so the electricity is actually a built in cost and I have excess because of solar generation credits.

hh2rq3q comment Nodes validate and relay txs.

Those txs get picked up by miners and are included in new blocks. Statistically on average every ten minutes a block is filled with a "golden nonce" (like a random lottery ticket) and forms a new valid block. It is relayed by nodes across the network and if really is valid, it is appended to each node's copy of the chain.

The process repeats, over and over with some adjustments for speed (hash rate) periodically to keep the average at ten minutes.

If you want to attack the blockchain you'd need a high enough hash rate so that the blocks you create beat out other miners so that the chain becomes primarily built by you. 51% is the minimum but in reality you'd need more to  mine enough so that other miners statistically cannot keep up with the chain you build, ie. you select txs in this chain by including/excluding in your blocks.

Let's say another miner adds a tx you don't want in a block. You'd have to mine a competing block, without the tx and broadcast it such that your chain stays longest. The longest chain is the true one, and is why you should wait for several confirmations before accepting a tx as final. 

It's possible for the chain to temporarily "fork", for a few blocks, called an orphan chain, before back tracking on to a different longest chain.

It's important to realize this process is not controlled by anyone but arises spontaneously out of the behavior of each node and/or miner, using the software they run. Choosing software determines the chain you continue to build on. 
hh36l9l comment There is no universal blockchain. Every node has one.

There are nodes run by users, and nodes run by miners. Miners also run mining hardware, which generates blocks. A block generated by a miner's mining hardware is added to the blockchain on their node, then broadcast to other nodes over the network.

No one can maliciously change the blockchain because there are rules enforced by every node. 
hh2pazx comment Here is how:
- I buy 100 million USD worth of Bitcoin miners from you, using BTC as the payment.
- I turn my machines toward rewriting the whole blockchain from the point where I bought the miners from you (leaving OUT the transaction where I sent my coins to you)

I can just rewrite all the blocks the same, leaving out transactions which include the coins I‚Äôm trying to steal back.

If I can create a longer chain than the real chain, I will have taken back those coins from you without your permission. 
hh2vjww comment > Aren‚Äôt all data on the blockchain immutable? 

A blockchain is only as immutable as the energy stacked onto it. Theoretically speaking, they are perfectly mutable, it just takes a lot of energy to mutate. 

> How can I malicious actor try to change do sth like reversing their own transaction or the transaction of others? 

All you need to do is create a chain longer than the existing chain that doesn't include certain transactions. Thereby effectively reversing and censoring transactions.

hh2pt6f comment How do you turn your machine to do that? How are you able to pick and choose the transactions to include/exclude? 
hh2z7jx comment Thank you! 
hh2rbyb comment You write software to do these things. That‚Äôs how it works now. Miners prioritize higher-fee transactions. So they‚Äôre obviously checking things about every transaction before including it into a block.

The attacker would just add a few more rules to exclude specific transactions they want to erase.

hh2q0f3 comment - The internet of money by Andreas Antonopoulos

- Bitcoin: the future of money? by Dominic Frisby

- The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous

And if you want to get an idea of the "Why?" of Bitcoin I would recommend "The Sovereign Individual: Mastering the transition to the digital age" by William Rees-Mogg.  It was pre bitcoin (1997) but goes into why the world will need it and it is this book which many bitcoiners get their ideas around the concept of the Sovereign Individual.  

Also do check out The Singularity is Near by Ray Kurzweil which teaches you a lot about disruptive technologies and what happens when multiple technological breakthroughs happen concurrently, as is occurring right now.

Many books recommended at [Loop's blog](https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/books.html)

[The Bitcoin Standard](https://saifedean.com/thebitcoinstandard/) is still my favourite book so far.

[The Bitcoin Times](https://medium.com/the-bitcoin-times) - different top Bitcoin authors

[Fantastic read](https://medium.com/heyamber/the-journey-of-a-bitcoiner-3adddb7126d9)

Or if you prefer videos: Who Wants To Be A Bitcoin Millionaire? - BBC Panorama I like this video because it's made for NoCoiners but still manages to explain how the whole technology works (second half). [https://youtu.be/Q0ZfftQxsYs](https://youtu.be/Q0ZfftQxsYs)

But how does bitcoin actually work? This video is a bit more technical, but still explains the block-chain technology in simple terms. [https://youtu.be/bBC-nXj3Ng4](https://youtu.be/bBC-nXj3Ng4)

Once you're done with the first two. Bitcoin for Beginners - Playlist made by Andreas Antonopoulos Andreas is one of the best people in Bitcoin community and I feel like everyone has to meet him right at the beginning of their journey, down the rabbit hole.

hh2uodr comment This reads like all the financial Wall Street gurus in the 90s ridiculing Amazon.  They too, said it was a bubble.  At around the time Paul Krugman said the internet would have no more effect on global business than the fax machine.    

The lesson to learn there is, people in Wall Street don't know much about technology nor what happens when multiple disruptive technologies on the internet start coming together and forming entirely new market verticals (AI, bitcoin, metaverse, NFTs, Lightning Network)...

I would wager if you asked this guy "Do you know what Layer 2 / Layer 3 Sidechains are?" he would give you a blank stare.  Which means he doesn't have much of a grasp on where this is all heading.

first time over $1000: Nov2013

first time over $10000: Nov2017

last time under $100000: ?

total time spent between first entering and last leaving 5-figure BTC: ?

\-

first derivative:

(1-10)-(10-100):

28 - 20 = 8 months

(10-100)-(100-1000):

47 - 28 = 19 months

(100-1000)-(1000-10000):

82 - 47 = 35 months

\-

second derivative:

((1-10)-(10-100))-((10-100)-(100-1000)):

19 - 8 = 11 months

((10-100)-(100-1000))-((100-1000)-(1000-10000)):

16 - 11 = 5 months

\-

assuming a constant third derivative (for no particular reason):

projected second derivative:

16 + 5 = 21 months

projected first derivative:

35 + 21 = 56 months

projected total time between first entering and last leaving 5-figure BTC:

82 + 56 = 138 months

projected last time under $100000:

Nov2017 + 138 months = May2029

\-

conclusion:

play the long game

aka, HODL

\-

disclaimer:

there's not enough datapoints for this to be even close to reliable - in addition to many other factors, since each previous bull market peaked just above one of the level data points used here, coincidence in those peaks would translate to coincidence in the duration spent at these levels, i.e. if we pass $100k this cycle and continue much higher and the next bear market (due to inflation or other factors) doesn't dip below $100k, we could even see a negative first derivative for this most recent interval in the case of passing 100k next month and never dipping below it again

\-

tl;dr:

HODL!!!

I also noticed that the BBC subtly buried a bitcoin ad in the Prince William and David Attenborough "Earthshot" series which is currently going viral amongst world leaders and populaces around the globe.  

That's a pretty big deal, the BBC have some of the tightest restrictions on advertising and product placement of any broadcaster in the world.  And, given the documentary is about deploying transformative technologies to save the environment, and was put together by leading climate scientists... the inclusion of a bitcoin ad tells us they're subtly giving bitcoin the green light regarding the environment.

qagluh submission Hashing question 
hh2uge5 comment There is a difficulty adjuatment every 2016 blocks (that can increase or decrease) to maintain the correct 10mins block interval. In general hashing power goes up with time, so the difficulty needs to go up to slow down blocks back to 10 mins. 
hh2upbe comment The number of zeroes required is to make the average block time 10 minutes. If more people are mining then the chance to find a block gets much higher, so every 2 weeks the hashing difficulty is automatically adjusted based on the previous hash power to keep the average block rate at 10 minutes. Since the hash power keeps going up and up the average block time actually works out to be less than 10 minutes by a little bit though. 
hh2uqcx comment You have to perform work to find a certain amount of zeros. This is the proof of work part of bitcoin.

The difficulty can be adjusted by increasing or decreasing the amount of zeros. This is the difficulty adjustment of bitcoin and it guarantees 10 minute blocks no matter how few or many computers mine (satoshi was alone in the begging, in the future the whole planet could be mining) 
hh2vq67 comment >  today a valid hash has to start with 19 zeros

I wish people would stop with this zeros nonsense. There are no zeroes in the code. Bitcoin uses a target under which a certain hash has to fall, if treated as a regular unsigned big integer. 
hh2yqj7 comment > So why exactly is this requirement in place in the first place? My uneducated guess would be that it‚Äôs there to prevent collusion‚Äôs  [...]

It has actually nothing to do with hash collisions. The requirement is there because we want to see the miners produce a Proof-of-Work. So why would we want miners expend energy? It's because we want them to have something at stake. It keeps them honest. Without a Proof-of-Work requirement, it's basically costless for them to create invalid blocks. In addition, having a chain of blocks that all have a proof-of-work, makes the blockchain practically "immutable", since there is a high computational cost for rewriting a chain of blocks. But most importantly, nobody should be able to create money without exerting effort. 

> Also are the amount of zeros required for a valid hash ever increasing?

No, the difficulty, or the number of zeroes as you put it, changes every 2016 blocks (approx 2 weeks), and is based on the moving average of the past 2016 blocks. It is adjusted in such a way, that it will take an estimated 10 minutes to find the next block. The process of finding blocks is a [Poisson process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_point_process), and the probability of finding a block at certain time follows a [Poisson distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution). There's Khan academy lesson if you want to know the details: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z-M6sbGIZ0

Strictly speaking, it's not about the number of zeroes, it's about finding small enough numbers. For example, if the target is 0050. Then 0040 is below target, and 0060 is above target. Both 0040 and 0060 start with 2 zeroes, but only one of them is valid. 
hh3g8yg comment It's the automatic difficulty changes (in this case increasing difficulty) that are built in to keep the average block time at 10 minute intervals....back when there was only a single miner (Satoshi) the difficulty would have been much easier, but still required on average 10minutes of hashing to solve. 
hh3yfdi comment > To my understanding in 2014 a valid hash had to start with 17 zeros

This is incorrect in two ways. Firstly, the "leading zero" requirement was specified in Satoshi's white paper in these words  

> The proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the hash begins with a number of zero bits

We take block #330000 from 2014, for example. Its hexadecimal hash looks like

    00000000000000000faabab19f17c0178c754dbed023e6c871dcaf74159c5f02

A hexadecimal digit is 4 bits. Therefore, this hash begins with 68 zero bits  

Secondly, the "leading zero bits" method is not used, because it only allows for adjustment in powers of 2. The target hash is a maximum value. A valid block needs to have a header which has a hash smaller than the current target  

Mathematically, a leading zero bit count is also a maximum target value. But it only allows for coarse adjustment - powers of 2  

> I can‚Äôt even begin to understand how many times the double SHA-256 algo has to be used and abused to find a single valid hash

The arithmetic is simple. The average number of hashes required is determined by the size of the target range (from zero to current target) relative to the size of the 2^256 space. In cryptography terms, using a target range means the miners are searching for a "partial collision"

> So why exactly is this requirement in place in the first place?

To create work. The work is required to force a delay between blocks. Bitcoin is not the homework spreadsheet on your laptop. Bitcoin is a system of many thousand independently operated nodes, each with its own copy of the Bitcoin blockchain. For the entire node network to stay synchronized, there needs to be a delay between blocks

> are the amount of zeros required for a valid hash ever increasing

Not always increasing, the target goes up and down. Every 2016 blocks, the elapsed time of the previous 2016 blocks is compared with the target time of 20160 minutes. The target is adjusted using a simple time ratio

    New Target = Old Target * (Actual Time of Last 2016 Blocks / 20160 minutes)

This means that if the most recent 2016 blocks were slower than 20160 minutes, the target increases to make mining easier for the next 2016 blocks

> hungry to learn and understand the mining process

Don't watch those "leading zeros" videos. They're worthless. See the Mastering Bitcoin book  
https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch10.asciidoc 
hh2waue comment So a valid hash doesn‚Äôt have the zeros requirement? Also what do you mean by ‚Äúa certain nonce has to fall‚Äù

qagniz submission Best apps to buy and hold Bitcoin? (Newbie here) 
hh2v1ry comment Every account that sends you a DM is a scammer 
hh35xy8 comment Because you're based in El Salvador, the best exchanges are Chivo & Strike, IMHO. 

Anyway, congrats on the move, it's never too late. ONLY INVEST MONEY YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE.

Price wise, nobody knows what the price will be tomorrow, nor next week. Statistically, it's less than four years from now. Anyone who bought Bitcoin at any point in the past and held it for 4+ years is in profit. 

**Try "Bitcoin ONLY" strategy for at least first year**, you'll sleep much better. Newcomers lose so much money, holding garbage tokens just because someone on YT told them to.

Going DCA is probably the best approach, IMHO. 
Bitcoin to me, is a savings account. If I have some spare cash, I exchange it for SATs. Once a week works best for me, but I'm getting paid weekly. If there's a 10% drop in the price since my last buy, I usually double my buy. This [DCA calculator](https://amber.app/calculate-your-investment/) might help to decide what will work best for you. In a few years, even $10 dollars a month can make a massive difference.

Install (or buy - in case you're getting Bitcoin in Thousands of $) one or more of these wallets.

A few good wallet choices:

[https://blockstream.com/green/](https://blockstream.com/green/) \- Top Security Features, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://bluewallet.io](https://bluewallet.io/) \- excellent, easy to use wallet, Open Source and Non-Custodial (although, Lightning is custodial!)

[https://www.wasabiwallet.io/](https://www.wasabiwallet.io/) \- Excellent privacy, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets.

Lightning wallets to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for very small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix 

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - excellent POS for small business owners as well as integrated Bitrefill or LN Pizza

[https://muun.com/](https://muun.com/) \- Muun, simple and elegant LN wallet

Hardware Wallets (to store larger amounts):

[https://trezor.io/](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're.

[https://coldcardwallet.com/](https://coldcardwallet.com/) \- ColdCaard is currently the safest and most recommended here.

There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend as not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, etc. Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. 

Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. Write them down on any piece of paper as well as the receiving address. Now wipe the wallet and generate a new wallet. If the seed words are different than the first set, you're safe to use it. 

Find an option to set a passphrase and use it. This will boost the security to another level. Never store the seed words and passphrase together. Use a different medium if possible. If somebody finds both, they'll be able to steal your coin. 

This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words and passphrase(s) safe.

Welcome to the rabbit hole and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions anytime during your Bitcoin journey.

hh5ctxi comment Hi I am new to crypto and I am trying to learn as much as possible in order to invest in BTC as early as possible. From what I understand it has a lot of potential in the future of BTC but I'm still having trouble knowing if it's a good idea to buy at 60k US if I plan to hold them for several weeks / months. Do you think we will have opportunities to buy lower? My knowledge is limited on the subject so I'm still having trouble forming my own opinion. I heard that it could rise very high and today's high could be the lowest of the next months.   


I understand that no one know what price it's gonna be tomorrow. But I also know that I am very new and I might miss an evidence. I plan on buying on red days for the next weeks and not sell until I made profits. I really plan to put my extra money like an investment at the bank. I already bought a cold storage to make sure I don't lose my money to hackers. ( as I said, I am need and probably exposed to scams )

So yeah, thank you for taking time to read my questions. 
hh5qvc5 comment Is there any legitimacy to the skepticism of "old traders" like the Big Short investors or other financial bigwigs regarding cryptocurrency? On the one hand, I'm curious about what their reasoning would be other than the obvious. Criticisms I've read:

\-Crypto is "meaningless and arbitrary", it's "just electricity". My thoughts would be that fiat currency is also largely arbitrary, not *actually* tied to GDP nor backed by anything but military prowess at this point. The US constantly raising their debt ceiling and western countries chronically overspending is potentially example of this arbitrariness.

\-"It's a bubble, it will crash". They don't seem to elaborate on why?

\-"It has no intrinsic value". How is fiat currency or *any* currency that different in the long run? Gold has no intrinsic value either, and gold represents similar things BTC does, i.e. scarcity, security, etc.

On the one hand it makes me nervous, but on the other hand I also can't help but wonder if many people still don't understand Bitcoin or other crypto opportunities well.

The main threat I can see are countries' leaders cracking down and heavily regulating it (as i.e. Jon Cuncliffe from Bank of England seems to be encouraging countries to), but I'm mostly interested in the prospective long-game here. I'm very new to all this so happy to be corrected.
