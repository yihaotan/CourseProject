hiox5cj comment First rule: Do not buy anything you do not understand.

You do not understand how Bitcoin works yet. Start doing research, read good books and watch informative videos (Andreas Antonopolous is a good start), if any of the videos you start watching ever mention price, close the video. If you are working in tech, read the whitepaper, if you are interested enough, read the source code.

Get a good grip of the mechanisms that govern bitcoin, understand how consensus is reached, how the game theory of bitcoin works.

Depending on your ability to understand complex concepts and your prior encounters with cryptography, game theory, and economics, this should take between 3 months and 2 years.

After you do this, wait for 3 months. Come back to Bitcoin, and with all of this knowledge, and with all of your hype having left your body in the past 3 months, you can really have a real decision about investing in Bitcoin. Until this point, only invest proportional to your understanding of Bitcoin.


About keeping it safe, buy a Trezor, from their website, not from Amazon or any other reseller, check the tamper proof packaging and make sure it hasn't been tampered. Create a wallet, follow all of the instructions the device prompts you to do. When it asks you to keep a backup, *PAPER AND PENCIL*. No you can't keep your backup in a notepad, on the cloud, on your phone, in your memory.

Paper

Pencil

at least 2 copies, two is one, one is none.

Hide them well, preferably in different geographical positions.

After you have done this, delete your wallet from your Trezor, and restore it using your backup.

At this point you can buy Bitcoin and send it to your Trezor.

Or you could ignore all of the above, and buy bitcoin and hold it on an exchange, have no conviction in your investment, and sell at any sign of a bear market, get annoyed, call all of crypto a scam, and avoid it as long as you can.

Pick your poison. I know being a reasonable investor is hard, but it is worth it.

Another suggestion is to look out for buy/sell strategies like DCA (Dollar Cost Average). It is among the most used techniques of investment in the crypto world, it is the most solid and with the highest possibility of returns.

hilh9im comment Damn this is like scratching off a lottery ticket. 
hilkg5g comment Please, please, please take your time!

There are many older websites that explain how to spend your keys from private wallets (like yours with 2 QR codes).  But please be careful, because the instructions that were acceptable many years ago, may provide you with a quick way to lose your bitcoin as more sophisticated attackers will find a way to steal your bitcoin.

There are 2 QR codes, so...

DO NOT SHARE THE LARGER QR code, nor the longer string of upper/lower case letters and numbers with anyone.   Do not take a photo with your phone either.

It is OK to share the SMALLER public key (aka address) which again is the smaller QR code especially if you want to use it to check your balance.  Visit this site, for example, https://www.blockchain.com/explorer

Ideally, you should set up an air gapped machine that runs electrum.   For example, here is a site which explains in all detail how to setup a couple of Raspberry PI machines.

https://armantheparman.medium.com/how-to-set-up-a-raspberry-pi-zero-air-gapped-running-latest-version-of-electrum-desktop-wallet-85e59ecaddc0

Congratulations, too, by the way!

qirtyh submission At a loss here 
hileegb comment We have a lot of newcomers entering the Bitcoin space recently who are exploring different exchanges and such. Some users are developing a habit of asking if various random websites some complete stranger PM'd them is a scam or not. Sometimes these sites are completely unrelated to Bitcoin. This is not the purpose of r/Bitcoin.

* Do not trust unsolicited messages telling you to check out some shady website.
* Do not trust Discord randos telling you that you won a prize.
* Do not trust anyone who promises guaranteed profits.
* Do not trust website with unpronounceable domain names
* Do not trust anyone claiming to give away free Bitcoin. (YouTube, Twitter, Discord)
* Do not trust anyone claiming they will double however much Bitcoin you send them.
* Do not trust 'pretty girls' on Tinder telling you about new investment opportunities.
* **If you have to ask** if some sketchy website or special offer is a scam, **then it probably is.**

You have to learn to think for yourselves. Recognize that there are many tricksters out there who will go to great lengths to separate you from your Bitcoin. Use your head and stay safe. If you send your Bitcoin to a scammer, it's gone forever. There are no refunds!

hilk507 comment Got a rough explanation of the strategy? 
himvxzk comment You can sell fractional calls on Deribit. 
hilkp91 comment Willy is a Chad. Listen and learn... 
hilpwsu comment Basically you would buy one Bitcoin (let‚Äôs say at 60k), then one contract of $BITO (at whatever price you think it will stay below by a certain date - Willy uses 72k in his example. This will net you 12k. Even if it runs above that price, your underlying Bitcoin will appreciate, so it‚Äôs considered a risk neutral trade. 

I wonder where you can actually execute this trade (fidelity?) but i used to sell covered calls before i got into crypto and it was a great income/yield producing strategy and I never thought to possibly use it in crypto. 
hilv6zb comment Did he say what a 72k call sells for? While it may be low risk you also give up any gain beyond the strike price. So if btc went to 92k then you'd leave 20k on the table and for me I couldn't live with that. Not at this time - maybe as we enter a bear market but I suspect the call wouldn't fetch as much.

hilp1rz comment tldr; El Salvador‚Äôs new Bitcoin Law is the most under-reported story of the past year. Lightning Network is moving Bitcoin closer to becoming a true universal medium of exchange controlled by the people, not by governments. Lightning network statistics have exploded since May, with network capacity expanding by an annualized 635%. Lightning apps onboard millions of people, creating exponential growth that can very quickly go from irrelevant to dominant.

*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.* 
hinjpai comment Few people in the general public understand this.

Many continue to criticize the Bitcoin network for being slow for everyday transactions without realizing that the Bitcoin Blockchain should be seen as the central bank with which transactions will not be made constantly.

The Lightning Network was designed to meet this need and its development continues to progress.

qissbf submission Bitcoin Lightning Network Upgrades 
hilm1ef comment >In this episode of ‚ÄúBitcoin Explained,‚Äù host Sjors Provoost and guest Christian Decker discussed SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT, a proposed new sighash flag that would enable a cleaner version of the Lightning Network and other Layer 2 protocols.

>Sighash flags are included in Bitcoin transactions to indicate which part of the transaction is signed by the required private keys, exactly. This can be (almost) the entire transaction, or specific parts of it. Signing only specific parts allows for some flexibility to adjust the transaction even after it is signed, which can sometimes be useful.

>Decker and Provoost explained that SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT is a new type of sighash flag, which would sign most of the transaction, but not the inputs. This means that the inputs could be swapped, as long as the new inputs would still be compatible with the signature.

>SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT would be especially useful in the context of Eltoo, a proposed Layer 2 protocol that would enable a new version of the Lightning Network. In place of how Lightning users currently need to store old channel data for security reasons, and could also be punished severely if they accidentally broadcast some of this data at the wrong time, Decker and Provoost explained how SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT would do away with this requirement.

hilpgum comment I would recommend making a coinbase account, they are the most user friendly exchange for beginners. Think of it as a service such as Fidelity or Robinhood but for crypto. In order to purchase crypto, you will either need to link your bank account to your coinbase account and transfer money in or use a debit/credit card to then purchase crypto. The money can be traced to you but it isn't illegal to link your bank and purchase crypto unless you plan on avoiding taxes. 

Start with google and just read a bunch of articles to get familiarize with crypto. There is plenty of confusing information out there and crypto can get very complex very quick but it isn't difficult to start. Good resource below:

hilnkad comment just address formats, wallet formats. there's plenty written on it.  segwit is a major upgrade, but as far as usability is concerned, it's just a new address type.  choose segwit. you'll save on fees. you might have some crappy services which don't recognize the new address format yet.  but just don't use them. they suck. worst case if you have someone who refuses to use segwit, you can create a new wallet to accept the payment, then forward it (or not) to your other wallet. 
hilnnl7 comment So if you send money from native segwit to legacy the money is lost right? 
hilqcbb comment No, it's fine. 
hilu02l comment The only compatibility issue is if you have a segwit address there may be dinosaur legacy services/people who cannot send to you as their wallet doesn't support segwit. To receive btc you'd have to pester them to upgrade or make a legacy wallet with which to receive and relay to your segwit one.

Segwit wallets, being newer, always support sending to other types. 

With taproot coming up soon you may now find wallets that cannot send to taproot addresses, until programmers upgrade the wallets for the new taproot address type.

hilps4r comment Yes 
him9aat comment To find out if something is centralized or decentralized, consider each aspect of the thing and ask yourself: "If I remove this, will everything keep running without it?"

For example, the Bitcoin network is comprised of thousands upon thousands of nodes. If you were to remove any one of them, the network as a whole would continue to operate. Therefore, that aspect of Bitcoin is decentralized. And, on the whole, Bitcoin strives for decentralization in all things.

To take another example, the entire idea behind Tether is that every Tether is backed by USD held in Tether Holdings Limited's vaults. If you were to remove Tether Holdings Limited, you would crush the entire idea of Tether as a stablecoin. Therefore, that aspect of Tether is centralized. 
hilrqkb comment sort of. depends how you define it. it's the only one which is truly censorship resistant to govt and large corporate attackers. if you consider privacy a measure of effective decentralization, then the privacy coins are pretty good too but they are so small and not really scale-able. they also aren't very palatable to commercial businesses, institutions, and corporate actors.  so they aren't even allowed to trade on most exchanges. bitcoin struck the balance necessary for mass adoption. and it's clearly the most secure (as a result of its decentralized structure) by a very very long shot.

him03gl comment Why is the dollar not just worth what a piece of paper is worth? 
hiltyf5 comment Because Bitcoin isn‚Äôt a global currency and you acquire Bitcoin with fiat, and most people use the USD. 
hilu4tr comment If you sell a bitcoin, what do you get back? Bitcoin? No, you get fiat. So even though Bitcoin isn‚Äôt tied to fiat, that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre selling for. You could also trade for goods or services. But majority of us today will be selling for fiat. So if BTC is worth a million and you decide to sell (or transfer for good/services), you‚Äôre doing it for a fiat value of $1 million 
hiluaxi comment It would take one million US dollars to buy one bitcoin. The better question is, who would trade one bitcoin for one million USD? I think time frame is important here.

hiluw0f comment I would tell them to carefully research the subject, don't take advice from randos. 
hilusob comment Why do you say just 7 k per year as of this moment? Didn't BTC jump from 13k to 58k this year alone? 
hinb0n4 comment 7% of 100k would no reach their goal of 20k per year however. 
himof8m comment Very true but btc has also gone from 20k to 3k in the drop of a hat.

You gotta be ready for volatility.

Most people cant handle it. 
hin745x comment Gains aren‚Äôt income they are appreciation. Selling stacks to earn income from gains carries sequence of returns risk. For example during a bull market the stack sold to earn X income from gains will decrease proportional to the gain in value over time; during a bear market the stack sold to earn X income will increase proportional to the decrease in value over time. 

Holding Bitcoin with Celsius (which is a bad idea due to ‚Äúnot your keys not coins‚Äù risk) will earn a residual income in the form of interest.

qiu34y submission Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Cryptography Question 
hilwldp comment A private key is simply a large random number (with a specific maximum constraint). 

Seeds are used to generate random numbers in wallets using some hashing and whatnot, but that's a separate issue and not ECC related. The main thing here is this process is deterministic - so it can be repeated and will give same random numbers later. Seeds are also simply large random numbers - the determinism passes the randomness of the seed along to the keys generated.

The private key is multiplied by the generator point to give you the public key. That's it. 

But keep in mind multiply in ECC is special and not the same as our daily multiply. The special multiply is very hard to reverse due to it's mod properties. 
hilwwle comment Thank you so much. Oddly enough the professor did mention that ECC‚Äôs use of multiplication was unique using a physical diagram. Have a wonderful day! 
hily6ov comment Well done .. Kudos 
hilxzxq comment there's a good description on EC group law on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve#The_group_law). Note that the ec dsa algorithm really works on *any* cyclic group.

edit: Since this is a group and not a field it's important to remember that the multiplication in this instance is just a shorthand for multiple additions.

hily0l3 comment tldr; Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak is a believer in both Bitcoin and blockchain technology. In an interview with Yahoo Finance, he called Bitcoin "mathematicical purity" and compared it to US dollars, which governments can "just borrow and borrow" and aren't actually "fixed" in supply. He added that if Bitcoin were to gain too much adoption, the US would ban it.

hinef0k comment The bigger Bitcoin gets, the more big investors come into the world, the less likely it is that America will be banned.

The interests of the powerful in the current system will soon be too closely tied to the success of Bitcoin for the authorities to attempt such a venture.

Besides, it would only justify Bitcoin a little more and attract even more users.

With BTC,  I don't know who owns the wallet,  but i know when and where it moved.  With the dollar bill,  I don't know anyone or anything. 
himukjk comment I disagree with him about it being banned. The more adoption, the more politicians fear moving against it. Their only purpose is to win elections and hold office. Adoption = voting out politicians against it. 
hinr2xg comment He‚Äôs only ten years late discovering this. 
hiv61sz comment Even after no meaning it is right and thinkable, don't you think. 
hinvg9i comment Steve found bitcoin very very late; then he got involved in competing blockchain initiatives in places like Malta, which means he has a vested interest in seeing alternatives to Bitcoin succeed. 

See:

https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2019-07-18/local-news/Delta-summit-launch-Apple-Co-Founder-Woz-launches-blockchain-company-in-Malta-6736211092

When old tech luminaries with competing interests come out and say things like "Government x,y,z will do this or that" it's worth remembering they have an alternative narrative to sell and a whole bunch of cognitive bias they may not even be aware of.  

On top of that, what expertise do they actually have in governance and global affairs?

The correct response is to say "Really Mr. Tech bro?  And how long have you been working in government?  What makes you an expert on statecraft and international diplomacy?  Perhaps stick to computer engineering..."

Same reason you wouldn't trust a computer scientist/engineer to give you sound advice on fixing your broken down car engine (for that, you need an expert car mechanic) we ought take what they say about governments with a pinch of salt.

himfqr9 comment It's so absurd how the media and central bankers have literally convinced everyone to change the definition of inflation to something so subjective and indescribable that nobody can even agree.  

The fact of the matter is that money printing IS INFLATION. Prices are a very complex system, like the weather. And similarly to how carbon dioxide doesn't doesn't directly correlate with immediate or even definite changes in global temperatures, money printing doesn't directly correlate with immediate or even definite price increases necessarily.   

But the fact remains the currency has been counterfeited. The damage is done when the money is printed. Because it's unethical and a crime to steal from people through counterfeiting their currency. That was never part of the deal.

himep8t comment I consider myself a financial ultra conservative. If we are 20 years earlier, in times of fiat debasement to be followed by heightened inflation, I would be a goldbug shifting as much net worth into gold as practical.   My grandma used to do that so it‚Äôs probably in the blood.  

However I had come across BTC before the recent avalanche of fiat debasement, thus when the goldbug cells in my blood were awoken in 2020, I accelerated shifting net worth into BTC instead.

BTC is the digital gold, I firmly believe.

hio9xsi comment Yet gold, ‚Äúthe hard money‚Äù and the ‚Äúinflation hedge‚Äù hasn‚Äôt matched it all. Gold is a terrible asset and terrible money because it can be debased with just as much ease as printing money from thin air.

him570y comment I want to know how this works, too. 
him9o03 comment I can only speak for the UK, but here you calculate your profit on disposal against the average cost of your coins. So if you bought 1@ ¬£1,000 and 1@ ¬£5,000 and then you sell 1@ ¬£10,000 your average cost is ¬£6,000/2 = ¬£3,000 and your gain on disposal is ¬£7,000.

They don't care which particular coins you are disposing of.

Down to you to keep records, to do the calculations and to declare all of this properly. 
himbs05 comment prove? just report it like everything else. you misunderstand the tax process perhaps. it's not court case where you have to prove things. they have to prove you are lying if they believe that's the case. there's a presumption of innocence in this *land of the formerly free and the home of the formerly brave*.  at least there was. maybe brandon, or the people pulling his strings changed that recently and i haven't heard. 
hinolfy comment On a go forward basis I would keep 2 seperate accounts/addresses in order to keep your bookeeping as easy as possible. If I was doing alot of transactions I would consider moving a sizable amount of BTC to the LN and transact from there. The privacy afforded should make voluntary reporting very easy. 
himujs3 comment You can use coin control with wallets like Ledger. So, when relevant (eg, selling bitcoin when you have long term and short term holdings), it will help keep your records clean so that you can refer back to them easily in the future.

qivl20 submission I want to support #TeamSeas and pay with crypto, how do I avoid layer 1 fees? 
him4yl4 comment The recipient needs to support lightning, which they most likely don't, so check that first. Secondly your exchange doesn't support sending on lightning, so you need to install a lightning wallet of your own, and transfer your bitcoins into it, thus incurring layer 1 fees.

So most likely you should just donate with layer 1. Fees are pretty cheap these days anyway. 
him61cf comment Fees have been at the minimum (1sat/vbyte) for months, that's literally 9 cent right now. 
himc79t comment Fees are currently at the lowest possible level - 1s/b gets you in a second block.

https://bitcoinfees.net/

If your exchange has LN implemented like [CoinCorner](https://support.coincorner.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020611739-What-is-the-Lightning-Network-) does, your fees will be minimal. This still isn't the best solution as you should HODL in your own wallet. **Not your keys, not your Bitcoin.**

Have a look at [Muun](https://muun.com/) or [Phoenix](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) Wallet, please.

Edit: links. 
him85gt comment Hey thanks for the reply. Sorry if this is a stupid question but I once sent a friend some Bitcoin as a birthday gift. He‚Äôs with the same exchange as I, so I sent the Bitcoin using layer 1 from my exchange wallet to his. I sent 0.00089005BTC and the exchange notes a fee of 0.00030000BTC which is more or less 30%. This is a fee I paid the exchange surely? 
himanh0 comment Exactly, OP should just use layer 1 in this case.

https://mempool.space

Feels cheap AF at this time 
himnyum comment Sounds like binance.

Sending to an address on the same exchange can be free.

Depending on the exchange.

Coinbase is free just use their email address.

Ftx is free to withdraw btc.

Gemini is free to withdraw.

Your paying the exchange fee not the btc fee. That should be tens of cents. 
himazrc comment Depends entirely on the exchange. If they check and determine that the recipient is another customer of theirs, they can just do an internal database update without any bitcoin transactions. In your case it sounds like they weren't that smart, and actually made a bitcoin transaction, and with a very high fee as well. Most exchanges batch transactions for multiple customers into a single one so they only pay one fee, and perhaps it's this fee you're referring to. In that case the fee was shared between you and many others, so it wouldn't be as bad.

As as wrote, on-chain fees are pretty low these days, but only if you can set them on your own. When you let a third party keep your coins, you can't do that. If you have non-triival amounts of money in Bitcoin, you should strongly consider getting your own wallet.

him7mcb comment Yeah, no. 
Maybe you will suffer outage in your home for some hours, but the scenery painted here is about preparedness if worst to happen. It is smart for everyone to be prepared with supplies and essential things for at least 2-3 days, better a week or two. 

Planned Power outages, which might become a case in Europe, never last long, and does not affect critical infrastructure. 
himhtgq comment ATMs and creditcard machines would be down too wouldn‚Äôt they? Even banking computer systems. On a global scale, Bitcoin transactions would be the least of our worries if this happens. 
hinvvbk comment So long as one BTC miner stays up we‚Äôre good baby! (This is potentially incorrect but I hope it‚Äôs correct) 
hinwdub comment You can bet the telecoms/banks/pharma aren't going to go without power, so... It's just outages for the slaves. 
hiol6yp comment Bitcoin is also available via Satellite thanks to Blockstream. So even everything is down at you region, you can use satellites 
hipe40d comment Its not like power is 100% completely lost to everyone and all power plants shut down. Ising the Texas freeze as an example, you have some plants that went down. Critical infrastructure was maintained or at least only ‚Äúcurtailed‚Äù. There were rolling blackouts where power is provided for a couple hours and down for then for several. In other words, if you are buying thing locally using bitcoin (which, I don‚Äôt know why anyone would spend bitcoin in the middle of a bull market, but that is a different discussion) you may have some trouble, but purchasing things online shouldnt be an issue.

himjpmx comment Are toothpicks holding the symbol up or are you a master carver? 
himot24 comment Very nice 
hint8s8 comment Aw thanks, I like your username, btw. Neverending Story rocks. 
himbspx comment What's that? 
himber2 comment If you are on mobile then all you have to do is hit the plus sign and upload an image, it will give you the option to select which subreddit to upload it to. I'd like to see yours, too. 
hint5va comment Good eye, yup those are toothpicks! 
himbzax comment Cool pumpkin but if you put it outside you‚Äôre advertising that you probably own bitcoin. Someone takes a wrench and threatens to beat you unless you give up your keys.

Paranoia maybe but just giving you a heads up.

himr0rk comment Who was suggesting a forced vax? Twitter nonsense people? So he jacked up the nonsense and violated some terms of service? Am I getting this right? Genius move by everybody. I'm not really seeing a possibility where that sort of threatening bravado was a response that was necessary or made some important point.

This is further proof that @jack needs to be ostracized from bitcoin community. He's not a fellow-traveler - he's weak and unprincipled.

hiqt5m5 comment I didn't know that too. These are his exact words from an email exchange I had with him a week ago, so it should be true.

himgtt4 comment Can I have 0.734 btc plz 
hime7tm comment online? no. either you have the private keys or you don't. either you have an account with a service or you don't. 
himc2a4 comment Yea. I had 10 millions dollars. But I forgot where, can someone help me out? Maybe it's somewhere hidden, I am not sure. Who knows and can help me?

I also tried looking for it in a sock drawer, but it wasn't there. 
himd9sp comment Yes if you can remember where your keys are. Your BTC resides on the ledger. You just need to bring proof that they are yours.

himr1ck comment Thanks for bringing bitrefill to my attention 
himpai1 comment Ah yes Bitcoin‚Äôs another big advantage is easy to use.

No shitty bank-stuff, just digital money. 
hinadip comment The beauty in bitcoin's 'trustless' nature is that like OP says, you can transmit value quickly without needing to do annoying and time consuming site registrations etc with your identity. The vendor really doesn't need to know a single thing about you other than that your lightning payment just came through as confirmed and now they've gotten their settlement. Makes everything so much smoother and easy and takes it's usefulness to another level.

hiok45s comment > recharged her phone with 40k

I was like.. this man really loves his mom 
hin7c85 comment I had a customer ask me about Bitcoin, and we had a long discussion. 

Later that day, he sent me a copy of an email his bank sent him and an apology that he couldn‚Äôt pay me for a few days. This was because while he was paying his vendors, his bank told him he had already hit his transaction limit, and he‚Äôd have to wait. It was a perfect case-in-point for what we had just been discussing.

I long for the day when one doesn‚Äôt have to convert to fiat currency at all.

qixpnw submission What are the risks of exposing my bitcoin wallet address in social media? 
himhfsq comment No, all they can do with your wallet address is send funds into it, although the blockchain is public and people can see your balance and transactions 

In a way it's similar to sharing your bank account number, you need to disclose this in order to receive wire payments and giving this to say your employer for example does not mean that your employer can in any way access your funds, of course fraudsters can use this information if they have your real name to contact your bank pretending to be you in order to gain information,  it's a long process and it takes several failed phone calls but they can gather information just based on the security questions asked by the agent answering the phone at your bank or building society

Sharing your wallet address is actually safer than sharing your account number since fraudsters cannot call the bitcoin line to phish for information 
himi1h7 comment The only risk is privacy. People can watch that address and see any future payments in and out of it. So if you ever decide to transfer it out, people will know. And they‚Äôll know which address you transferred it to. 
himklij comment To answer your question, there are only privacy risks, not security - your wallet can't be hacked if you exposed the receiving address. 

If you have a Twitter account, this might be a better solution https://tippin.me/

himq93q comment It's called Rubber Hose Cryptanalysis. Google it. 
himgi0p comment No. 
himnudd comment Create a new address and use it only to receive donations. Drain it regularly to your private address. Problem solved. 
hina2pv comment You can have multiple wallets. Just use a ‚Äúburner‚Äù for your YouTube comments and transfer to cold storage or something 
hina45a comment Mathematically it is not possible to derive your private key from your public key, so that is safe.  However, anyone can track that particular address so there could be privacy concerns. 
hinw79x comment It‚Äôs like giving out your bank account number.  Only difference here is the blockchain is public so anyone can see what‚Äôs your balance.  No risks as such but if someone can identify your identity while you share your address and you have substantial balance then there‚Äôs a chance you might get kidnapped. 
hinwvrl comment No risks in terms of losing funds, the risk is with privacy, everyone can see your past and current transaction history and link it to you personally, you‚Äôre also telling people you own Bitcoin which is a bad move as a lot of them probably know where to find you and your recovery seed :)
