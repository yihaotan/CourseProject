hgakrf5 comment Ok but how you gonna buy my diamonds if you don't have crypto.  I don't accept worthless fiat. 
hgakxiu comment Was this written by a 9 year old? 
hgamme9 comment The IRS auctions any type of asset to collect tax debt. If the IRS can't collect cash from a delinquent taxpayer, then they'll seize your property and sell them on an auction. Why bother seizing bitcoin if they didn't see any resale value?

I don't follow your logic. 
hgakzbo comment You completely lack understanding about:  
* Bitcoin  
* Diamonds  
* The IRS  

I suggest you get a job and start learning about the real world. 
hgamgyb comment Diamonds are near worthless. The industry is literally run by a cartel that fixes the prices by artificially manipulating the scarcity. A **centralized** cartel, I might add.

Plus, you can literally just make them in a lab out of one of the most abundant elements on the planet.

Diamonds got nothin' on Bitcoin. 
q69n79 submission When will Satoshi win the Nobel Prize in Economics? 
hgalrq5 comment If Nobel Prizes aren't granted to dead people, they probably aren't given to people who are impossible to contact, either.

Probably for the best. Heaven forbid they accidentally give it to some dipshit poser like Craig Wright. 
hgaozsx comment You think Satoshi will accept as humble as Satoshi has been this far? 
hganlvf comment He's far superior to Krugman.  That "award" doesn't mean anything good now. 
hgalvxd comment Never. Afaik in order to "get" the Nobel Prize you need to give an acceptance speech. Also I don't think Satoshi would doxx themselves like that. 
hgamsuo comment People tried to nominate him but pseudonymous people are not eligible. Also he's almost certainly dead and so even if he were nominated under his real name he still would not be eligible. 
hgb1rm4 comment The full name of the Nobel Prize in Economics might reveal the reason why Satoshi will never get it:

"The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel".

This is [their current opinion of Bitcoin](https://cryptocurrency.net/trading-bitcoins-like-trading-stamps-says-swedish-central-bank-governor/):

> In comments at a Swedish banking conference, Sveriges Riksbank Governor Stefan Ingves warned that private money "usually collapses sooner or later." The governor of Sweden's central bank, the Sveriges Riksbank, has dismissed Bitcoin (BTC) as an altogether far-fetched alternative to government-backed fiat currencies. 
hgantog comment When BTC hits $420,690 
hgbtkf9 comment I propose we create a Nobel Prize alternative minted as NFTs with awards that can be sent to pseudonymous winners. Time to stop paying tribute to dynamite for the scientific and social advances that are many times its worth. 
hgao4l2 comment no mention of censorship resistance? no mention of confiscation resistance? no mention of being open to everyone? no mention of finite supply?  financial sovereignty? separating money from state? you failed to mention bitcoin's principle design features. are you afraid bitcoin's anti-state origins and intentions make it unappealing to the nobel prize committee? because you would be right, it does. 
hgaz4t0 comment the rules state the prize cannot be awarded posthumously [1], so Satoshi would have to give up his anonymity to prove he is alive.

hganfb0 comment Another dinosaur 
hgapzk6 comment At this point its just plain misdirection and not even ignorance anymore; Dimon says this absolute stupid shit, meanwhile JPM is buying BTC behind the scenes and is launching BTC etfs.. 
hgayvqp comment The fact that all these bankers are getting into it (e.g. Fidelity) or FUDing it (e.g. JPMorgan) is telling.  They wouldn't all be taking positions if it wasn't front and center in executive board meetings.

We're watching them feel the crucible of BTC game theory in real time.  Embracing bitcoin makes it more likely to succeed - which (as the largest holders of dollar denominated debt) could destroy them.  Failing to embrace it will *guarantee* their destruction if BTC succeeds without them.  Each bank that jumps in applies more pressure to the others to do the same - a positive feedback loop.

In a SHTF type situation you can disassemble it and make a small disco ball out of it and signal for help. Or not signal for help and just use the disco ball for other things like maybe fishing or something.

Solid buy there.

q6aedc submission How we know it’s going to be mined only 21 millions BTC ? 
q6ahd6 submission Modifying the 21 million btc cap 
hgar3yz comment [deleted] 
hgb0git comment Bitcoin is a network of nodes that keep making sure the rules of the game are followed.

One of those rules is that there will only be 21M Bitcoins, ever.

Anyone can create a fork that changes this rule, and offer it to the world. But the vast majority of nodes will continue to use the current Bitcoin rules, because it's in their own best interest.

Also, even if you believe there might be a lot of people opting for any new set of rules, you can always run your own node.

Not your node, not your rules. 
hgaqx02 comment of course it's programmable. but nobody can make us run the program that increases it. and why would we?  you should start from the beginning and learn how bitcoin works. 
hgari47 comment There is no board of Btc coders. Miners and nodes (everyone can have a node) can decide changes to protocol. If that occurs and not all are aligned, a hard fork can happen (as when BSV and other were created). However, as noted, why would someone want to depreciate the value of his holding by increasing the limited supply? 
hgaxe3y comment At least 4 groups have a say: coders, miners, node operators, holders. They all would have to agree. If all fails, holders can sell their new coin and it gets marginalized like bcash. 
hgbihy2 comment Yeah you can make it’s 24 million coin, you can even make it a zillion coins. And then you can call it whatever you like too, because Bitcoin will live on 
hgasimr comment Yes, if all the miners (or rather a majority in terms of capacity) conspired, they could do that.  
I expect that would crash the price of bitcoin, so they won't.  
Nonetheless it is a real concern in the very long term. Right now mining is plenty profitable, but five halvings down the road there might come a point when miners started to propose adding maybe just a little tail emission, or stopping the future halvings, or... what have you. Unfortunately the timber of humanity is so crooked that nothing entirely straight can be built from it, as the philosopher said. But bitcoin is a damn fine attempt at doing it nonetheless. 
hgaybr3 comment I have seen the actual code. 
hgar258 comment I'm sure the cap could be modified if 51% of the network agreed to it.  But why would they?  That would just devalue everyone's existing holdings.  If you wanted to increase liquidity, you could simply allow smaller denominations, but SATs are already quite small as it is, so they should be sufficient to ensure liquidity for quite a while.

hgarw2p comment I thought I was too late when I invested at 10k in 2017 🤷
I'd wait for a pull back before getting in but in a few years I believe it will all be irrelevant. 
hgas065 comment Ah last ever chance to enter was like 30 seconds ago, unlucky. 
hgarpnw comment I wish people didn't ask this every single day. What a dumb question 
hgarxug comment It’s never too late. But unless you plan on holding for years and can stomach your $1000 going to $500 or lower, I wouldn’t bother. Getting to $100k by year end is not a sure thing. 
hgaseyf comment So far, it's never been too late.  The two missed opportunities - maybe the price went down later but is it higher now? 

Eventually, it may be too late or it may not ever be too late.  However, it has never been too late so far.  What are you waiting for? For it to be too late? 
hgasoq8 comment Do not put the whole amount at once , DCA every week or month what you can afford. No matter the price don’t let emotions get you out of the plan.

hgdtvxs comment Better sink your entire life savings in it if you haven't already 
hgb046l comment Yea when can I loan my holding to us treasury? 
hgb06gz comment technically, it cant be infinite
because it means one bitcoin = infinite value, not the full 21M supply.
and that means one bitcoin (infinite value) is worth as much as the full 21M supply (also infinite value).
which cant be true, how can one unit of something be the same as 21M unit of the same thing. 
and it cant be infinite value as it can then buy everything including itself. so are you saying bitcoin is a black hole, sucking everything (energy, life and even bitcoin itself)??

hgathkb comment Mine crypto through a pool or using something like nicehash to receive BTC as payment. 

This allows you to constantly receive BTC at regardless of the value and by converting electricity to BTC you are constantly DCAing your purchases. 
hgb7ynf comment Swanbitcoin.com. Lowest fees .99 percent if you buy $50 or more per week and prepay your fees annually. 

It’s slow but that’s what keeps the fees low. Being slow eliminates charge back frauds.

hgavctr comment I dont think coinbase pro has recurring purchases unless this was added recently 
hgatm4u comment Also nothing has a 0 purchase fee.  They find a way to charge you, usually by increasing the spread so you are not buying crypto at the current actual value. 
q6aups submission The long term effect of the global DCA army 
hgau0na comment Only problem with your argument is that several adopters in developing countries might not be contributing 10k per year (especially considering how low nominal wages are without adjusting for PPP), so I’d reckon you’d need a much higher percentage than 5% to get the results you’re talking about 
hgau49p comment huh? what does any of this have to do with reality? 
hgb86bg comment People all over the world with average to below average salaries for their countries and cost of living can’t afford to contribute 10k a year. Most certainly not 1 in 20. Otherwise it sounds good. Lol 
hgbuhzw comment You're naive un thinking that the cummulative power of retail investors is relevant. We're in an institutional era, where buying multiple million $ worth of bitcoin in one go is the way to go. Retail barely makes a dent, it's mostly just noise if investors shifting coins around to each other because they are happy with 500% gains. Don't underestimate corporate greed. Bitcoin is an equalizer, they have as much access to it as everybody else, the difference is the pule of money they have to invest and the army of advisors they have on their operations. 
hgcc40c comment I think the point is that in the future retail will make a considerable dent. Imagine 100,000,000 retail people worldwide buying $30 per week on average - that is a very realistic scenario 
hgcmlh6 comment > that is a very realistic scenario

right. Keep on drinking the hopium. We've just a couple of days seen 1 transaction for half of the weekly volume you suggest in your extremely optimistic scenario. Retail is irrelevant. 

It's almost like saying that retail is important in buying Disney stock...

He says it’s worthless but it doesn’t matter because our customers want it and we can make money off them. . .  

It’s like the CEO of a newspaper saying the internet is worthless but we will be putting our newspaper on the World Wide Web for people to read .  .  .

The internet disrupted all the media gatekeeers such as newspapers and thousands went out of business because the internet allowed everyone to become their own media outlet!

Bitcoin is disrupting all the financial gatekeepers and banks will adapt or go out of business because Bitcoin- the internet of money allows everyone to become their own bank!

History is repeating itself and Bitcoin is more disruptive than the internet . . .

It’s your money but at higher interest rates… if you need money for bills you cash out your stablecoins and it’s back in your wallet within 3-5 business days.  Keeping 6 months of money in a bank at 0.01% yield is really losing 5% to inflation.

Been doing this since the crash (after taking profits from my 2018 investments ) and I’m up an easy 60-70% across all the cryptos I hold. I plan on exiting a large portion to make investments in real estate EOY. Depending on how high we go this year, I will only take out what I need. I’m confident in my potential earnings if I really need to work 5 days a week I will but right now I don’t do that because I like to enjoy my life. I work in the hospitality industry so tips are part of my earnings and can vary quite drastically, however I’ve been doing what I do for years and am very effective and consistent in my earnings. If you have high earning potential compared to your expenses I would be all in but that’s just me. I don’t care about money and it won’t make me happy. Just trying to be smart about what I have. I see the 60-70% gains as break even with the amount of inflation and financial infrastructure breaking around us. It’s still a hedge to me even at such a high profit. It’s not an investment until the markets already collapsed in my opinion.

q6cywd submission The Plain Bagel - Dangers of Bitcoin 
hgd09sh comment TL;DR:

-	Bitcoin is conflated with blockchain
-	Bitcoin has inflated demand (speculative)
-	Bitcoin has no intrinsic value
-	Bitcoin uses a lot of electricity
-	Bitcoin only supports 7 txns per second
-	Bitcoin is deflationary
-	Bitcoin community is fanatical (greater fool argument)
-	Bitcoin is not a safe haven from economic crashes.
-	Bitcoin price can still be manipulated by governments.
-	the tulip argument
-	the drugs/terrorists/pornographers argument
-	comparisons to pre great depression, dot com bubble

Might have missed a few. Would be interesting if he’s put out any recent videos on the subject.

They’re not bad arguments at the time, I think. I’ve seen his videos before, and he’s clearly super informed about economics. He was also right about Bitcoin being a bubble at that point in time.

Some things have changed for sure. The public outlook of crypto has improved, and people are more interested in it. I don’t think you can scare people off with the tulip or drugs/terrorist arguments anymore.

Also, the Bitcoin Lightning network has changed the game on economic / scalability concerns, and in general, Bitcoin mining has an argument for being the best return on energy costs, incentivizing energy industries to be more green.

I think I do agree that the crypto space is speculative, which is bad for Bitcoin. Tons of people are going to get burned by pump and dumps, and I think that we’re probably in another BTC bubble right now. 
hgb96rm comment I know this is an old video but the nice thing about that is we get to see he was right about the 2018 bubble. 
hgbed5v comment I just watched the video. I once used all his arguments and discouraged my friends from buying Bitcoin. I was wrong. Now I tell everyone to buy Bitcoin. When the facts change, then I change my mind.

hgbb3re comment You need a [Bitcoin wallet](https://bitcoin-only.com/wallets).

With that, you just send Bitcoin to the address of the merchant. Kinda like sending an email. That's how you pay in Bitcoin.

There are many resources to learn on that same website. 
hgbdji3 comment all you need to do is click send.  i think you're confused though. you aren't getting any benefits by using bitcoin for online purchases. you will pay fees to buy bitcoin, withdraw it from the exchange, and then again to send it for payments. and you have to do extra accounting for taxes for each transaction. so why do you want to use bitcoin? 
hgbc224 comment It's easy to get on an exchange like Coinbase. It's even more important to understand how it all works. 
hgbntw0 comment > a guide

Nobody is going to write a guide which says "Click send" ...  

Bitcoin wallet apps are free  
https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet  

The merchant site told you its Bitcoin receiving address and the amount of Bitcoin to pay  
Select "Send" in your Bitcoin wallet app  
Paste the site's address  
Enter the Bitcoin amount  
Send the Bitcoin 
hgbpgkt comment If your goal is to gain and maintain wealth, don't spend bitcoin. The best advice for a newcomer is to use something simple like Coinbase and set a weekly buy schedule. Like $10 per week. Do this while you study what bitcoin is and the problems it solves in today's world of finance. Spend 100 hours reading and watching videos. 

Look into Robert Breedlove, Parker Lewis, Michael Saylor, Lynn Alden, Willy Woo, and Preston Pysh for starters.

Because here's the problem. You won't be able to hold onto this asset without the macroeconomic conviction that comes from studying what you have. Without the proper educational foundation you are at risk both when the price of bitcoin screams upward and when it nosedives. You may see a 1x return and think omg I have to lock in those gains and sell out, completely missing the forest for the trees. And, similarly, you may sell at a loss during a 70% pull back when mainstream financial and other media love to publish constant articles about said pullback. 

You have to learn. And you will. But give yourself a few months. Meanwhile, setup your weekly DCA. 
hgdla2a comment As others have said, currently it's not advised to use Bitcoin for unnecessary spending you couldn't already do with cash. If you believe Bitcoin will appreciate in value compared to your local currency, it makes more sense to spend your local currency as it's losing value the more you hold it.

Not sure of the tax laws in your country in regards to crypto - but many countries view crypto as property and not a currency: therefore you could risk incurring a realised gains tax every time you spend it . 
hgetnjy comment You gotta keep it in a wallet then you can do the purchase. I'm using an enterprise grade wallet that makes it safer I can say. 
hgl8ykq comment those who accept crypto payments use either a direct bitcoin (or other cryptocurrency) address or a crypto payment gateway (there are many different, my personal fav is NOWPayments) — for that one needs an account where they put a certain wallet and create an API key 
hgbb7ic comment Honestly, it's too early to think of Bitcoin as currency. There is some cryptocurrency that is being used to purchase certain types of digital goods, but for all intents and purposes, Bitcoin is an investment asset. The time will come for it to be used as currency. In the meantime, just hodl. 
q6d8dz submission Is there a home network security buff listening? 
hgbcxx9 comment Depends what you want: security is always a balance of features vs cost.  For most folks, provider equipment is enough but since you’re running Umbrel you probably want something tighter.  Middle range answer is to get your own dedicated modem and hang a router w/firewall directly behind it.  Stateful firewall capability is highly recommended but I don’t know your budget.  You can prob get a modem and decent router w/ some firewalling for $300-400.  Best of luck to you.

Edit: and do not, under any circumstances, use public ip addresses on any of your kit.  Ever. 
hgbex6e comment [deleted] 
hgbwe65 comment I always strongly recommend labotomizing the provider router into a "bridge-mode" modem-only, if possible.

Take the public IP on your own router, and build your own network from there.

If you are competent, I can strongly recommend Mikrotik. Near-Cisco-like capabilities for a tiny fraction of the price. 

RouterOS is not geared for consumers however, it gives you enough rope that if you don't know what you're doing you *will* hang yourself.

q6e0a9 submission Question about tax on Bitcoin/crypto 
hgbgm6g comment Yes, any sale of Bitcoin (whether into fiat, USDC, another altcoin, goods or services, etc.) is a taxable event, at least in the US. 
hgc9i5o comment On the other hand you hold your 1BTC, and use it for collateral on a personal loan at 5% for 25k. Next year you would still own your BTC (worth how much? 120k?) And you would need to repay your loan plus interest for a total of $26250. 
Now take a new loan still backed by your  1 BTC (at a lower rate because your collateral is worth much more than the loan) get $51250 at 1%(gotta repay that first loan)....in a year you still own your BTC (now worth 250k?) But owe $51762.....and so on and so on
Not only is this not a taxable event you may ev n be able to claim a tax loss against your interest payments 
hgbhcod comment Of course this depends on your own specific situation, what country you reside in, your citizenship, etc.

But in general, most countries consider Bitcoin as an asset.

Any time you dispose your asset that's a capital gain(or loss) event.

This includes selling Bitcoin to fiat or changing Bitcoin to other crypto (if no change in fiat price, then no capital gain). Read about cost basis.

This is probably covered in detail in the website of the tax agency of your relevant country. 
hgbxrfv comment In the US, yes.  The moment you sell BTC for USDC, a taxable event has occurred.  You're obligated to track & report any gains or losses.

q6f4lz submission What happens to loans and interest payment in post BTC world !? 
hgbqbga comment There would be fewer of them, though at quite a low interest rate.  
In general, the expansion of our money supply through cheap credit leads to a lot of economic activity, which makes for nice big GDP numbers. But (at least from the perspective of Austrian economics) this is malinvestment - projects and activities that would never make sense to undertake if not for artificially cheap loans. Things like China's empty cities are a particularly glaring example, but we also have millions of empty houses in the US, prices propped up by REITs and people who can buy real estate with 3% mortgage interest rates.   
A hard currency like bitcoin means that borrowing is more painful and will generally only be done when real returns are likely to justify it. It would likely lead to less economic activity, which sounds negative to people who are used to idolizing GDP growth, but is actually a good thing in my opinion. 
hgbsujn comment In that scenario, debt could still occur but you would want to be certain that it was only for productive purposes. You would have to pay back the interest through providing extra work/value (goods and services) to others and honestly earning those sats rather than relying on the devaluation of the currency.

At the moment, you're only willing to take debt so casually because you implicitly understand that it will be easier to pay off in the future. The result of this is that access to credit, rather than hard work/productivity, actually determines who wins and losses in society. This feeds back into the ever growing inequality problems we face.

Another system that might work could be adapted from the principles of Islamic finance. If I'm getting this right, in that system debt is more of a mutual investment/partnership, and repayments are made through shared profits. No profits, no repayments, which is a much less exploitative system and aligns both parties toward mutual success. 
hge03hk comment Someone will always default. On default those sats will not be repaid, so they don't need to exist. Borrowing can still work. On default lender will then take the collateral, car, house, other asset, or labor. And borrower's cost of borrowing again will go up. 
hgbmu48 comment No more credit. Save before spending. That's the inevitable consequence of adopting a deflationary currency. All the 20th century assumptions about economic growth become obsolete 
hgbo3x8 comment Loans are subject to competition on the free market, just like anything else. If one lender over-charges and another doesn't, you'll go with the one that charges less. Therefore, each loaner is incentivized to charge the lowest interest rate they can while still making a return they can live with.

What this means is that under an inflationary system, they have to charge the borrower a higher interest rate to overcome inflation eating part of the returns.

Under a deflationary system, the opposite happens. They can charge the borrower a lower interest rate because deflation covers part of the returns.

Long story short, a deflationary currency is better for the common man, as usual. 
hgbv9p1 comment Short answer: we good family 
hgce8ip comment This is exactly why a Bitcoin Standard will not exist. I’m all for Bitcoin as property rights, but assuming it will supplant all currencies is a bit naive. 

Bitcoin makes debt very painful. Debt/credit has been used forever because it is useful. A Bitcoin Standard will never exist because it fails to provide a solution (that is better than what we currently have) for this core human activity. 

Austrian economic theory is basically debunked by the history of chartalism in every human society. It is an ideology, not a empirically tested theory 
hgbo0dc comment Payout the interest in a different crypto currency. 
hgc9wq7 comment Exactly

Debt (for nations) is sold as necessary for innovation (with the corresponding paycut in forefront taxes), but in reality it is a mean to enslave future generations.

https://youtu.be/XfQUOHlAocY 
hgcd4dh comment How is less economic activity possibly a good thing? I agree that there is some poor investment currently, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that a world with little investment would be better. GDP isn’t the only metric we should care about, but it is a useful indicator. 

Maybe I’m not imaginative enough, but I’m struggling to see this world existing without tons of unemployment

q6flu6 submission Jamie Dimon Calls Bitcoin Useless AGAIN!! That TRANSLATES to : HE IS REALLY BULLISH AND HE IS BUYING AGAIN! 
hgc2ayv comment I'm sorry, I am a cynic too, but who honestly thinks that JP Morgan, one of the largest banks in the world, has all its European aquisitions made by the CEO in the states? He says what he thinks, but branches havemtheir own specialists doing their own thing. 

Can this be a coordinated ruse? Absolutely. Can this be due to the fact that large banks rely on more than ONE person to do their investments? Yes, and most likely. 
hgc4pb1 comment In case you haven’t noticed, China, the US and a big group of other countries recently decided to try to discourage crypto.  It’s a threat to all of their fiat currency and financial systems. Jamie Dimon is just toeing the line.

q6fn60 submission Theoretical question: What will happen to Bitcoin if Satoshi Nakamoto suddenly shows up and actually proves that it is really him and we all believe him/her/them/it? 
hgbq1cn comment Nothing will happen to Bitcoin itself of course as it's designed to be decentralized.

Some people might react in different ways, driving the price up or down, but eventually it will not matter too much. 
hgbxhut comment **Satoshi is unimportant do the development of Bitcoin, we all are Satoshi!**

...I still have so much respect for his invention and disappearance, giving us the best tool to fight for freedom, without compromising his own freedom. 
hgbqngs comment The only way to remove his power is to sell all your coins. Careful now.... Don't think about it too hard. 
hgbti5f comment He could cause a significant price dip for a while, but he would have no influence on protocol development. 
hgbsex1 comment well gee, do you think it might matter what the circumstances surrounding this revelation are? and perhaps what words may be spoken by said character? and maybe what actions he has taken that lead to his identification? what's the worst thing you could imagine? he sells all his bitcoin at spot prices? bitcoin goes to 1 penny for a week? then what? bitcoin is dead! long live bitcoin! you should hope for as much. it will be the opportunity of the century. 
hgc5slo comment Would have some sell off. That would make it more distributed and talked about across the world. Then many would run nodes and use it. Back to moon. 
hgc61rh comment It would scare the shit out of me seeing a dead corpse walking around talking about Bitcoin. 
hgdlvn5 comment It would influence the market no doubt, as things do, but fundamentally nothing should happen as there'd be no need to.

Effectively, Satoshi Nakamoto has disowned Bitcoin as its decentralised. His only main influence would be his ownership of the 1million BTC wallet. 
hgcf5ck comment *Craig Wright has entered the chat.* 
hgc8ofe comment >he would have no influence on protocol development

That's an utterly senseless thing to say, as the developer of the protocol his words would carry huge weight! However at the end of the day, he would still need consensus on any changes he supported, and for that reason I sleep easy on the issue.

Your best bet is one of the peerTOpeer networks. Possibly you may have to find someone who is willing to deal with you privately and individually. Be prepared to pay steeper premiums.

hgbthm1 comment The code unveils a Satoshi Dick pic 
hgbtrj5 comment Then there are no more new bitcoins.

What do you mean what happens?

What happens when all the gold on earth is mined? Well… theres just no more gold other than whats already out there. 
hgbszsv comment it's literally asked multiple times per day.  search. 
hgbuijg comment After that, how will Bitcoin transactions be confirmed on the blockchain if there is no more Bitcoin to reward the miners? 
hgbum2b comment That's when you finally start buying. 
hgbuky7 comment This 👆 
hgbvj0f comment there is gold in asteroids. space gold. 
hgd9suk comment Do you understand how bitcoin is coded? He’s asking an obvious question about what happens after the bitcoin is all done and mined.  You do know that in order for all our TXNs to reach the designated address is because of the people mining each transaction and get a block reward  , the rewards they get is the “mined bitcoin”.  So his question is basically what incentive will miners have to continue to mine and spend electricity when there is no more bitcoin to be mined? If there is no more bitcoin to be mined, the miners won’t get rewards basically.  The code  will have to slightly change down the road that’s for sure.  No miners, no bitty 🤷 
hgbuswd comment The transaction fee will be the reward 
q6gl27 submission Guys, I want to bring a bitcoin ATM to my city. What is the procedure ? 
hgc2lv8 comment 1. Buy Bitcoin ATM.

2. Bring it to your city.

Optional:  3. Plug it in.

I mean, literally, that's all you have to do.  Pick a manufacturer and buy the thing and get it shipped to you.  The rest is ALL legal process stuff -- getting it through Customs clearance, whether or not you have to do KYC/AML, whether the government is going to confiscate it and throw you in prison for violating some code section.

Well, I guess there's some technical stuff, like configuring it and moving BTC into its onboard wallet and that sort of thing.  That's machine-specific and you should get a guide from the manufacturer to read through before you even buy it.

q6gvwa submission Vitalik is Wrong About Bukele’s Bitcoin Mandate 
hgcr8pv comment I mean a small business can just use chivo wallet to accept btc and immediately it gets converted to dollars.  
So even if it's forced, it's not like you need a lot of infrastructure. You don't even need to deal with Bitcoin by yourself. 
hgc0ksa comment Shitcoiner is salty El Salvador didn't implement his centralised premine. 
hgc77lz comment 1. Its not even a mandate, it was passed into law. It was not an executive order or anything like that. 
hgbxaxl comment tldr; Vitalik Buterin has called out Bitcoin maximalists for praising El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, who recently passed a law making Bitcoin legal tender alongside the US dollar. The law requires businesses to accept Bitcoin as payment when offered to them by whoever acquires a good or service. Vitalik called the law “reckless” and “unpopular”

*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.* 
hgcxg01 comment I think most "Bitcoin maximalists" would admit that there are concerns to raise about Bukele and the way the roll-out has been handled. Every single podcast and newsletter I follow has treated this subject with nuance. Alex Gladstein for example has been especially critical of Bukele. Which "maxis" is Vitalik referring to?

But we all recognise that regardless of a country's politics, Bitcoin adoption has tremendous upside for its citizens. This is what everyone is celebrating. If North Korea declared Bitcoin legal tender tomorrow, they'd cheer that on too (again, while recognising the nuance in the situation). 
hgbyz1a comment vbuterin wants to scam everyone with his shitcoin empire 
hgdiiez comment There is USD **And** BTC as legal tender in article 7.  So, most debtors would repay in USD as prior.  I would think most legal disputes will still settle in USD.  This is not an oppressive law since it includes the prior legal tender currency, USD.  Well, it's not more oppressive than the prior or general legal tender laws anyway. 
hgd6ton comment Vitalik is the oG shiller. 

I like him more than Charles righteous shilling azz. That isn’t saying a lot tho. Both morally corrupt individuals, who couldn’t control btc so they created their own coin to control it. 

F them. 
hgcdcdu comment we shouldn't force poor people to use Bitcoin. If it's a good alternative for them then they are going to use it them self. 
hgcvfxq comment I would prefer Bukele over Brandon! Where do I register for my Chivo?

hgc2fh7 comment This isn't a shitcoin sub.  GTFO with that crap.

Generally speaking, you are supposed to maintain consistency.  If you want a rules check, ask on /r/tax though;  sometimes an accounting rule doesn't apply to crypto when it does to everything else, for example wash sales.

Some tax rules even require multi-year consistency;  you can only switch every two (or more) years.

hgbxjpa comment Where'd I put that "porque no los dos?" meme, damnit? 
hgbxywl comment Why not both?  You said it yourself, it’s 100% return immediately into something that should also increase over time.  If you can afford it why not max out that company match and then dca the rest into btc. 
hgc5t54 comment Both… I have Bitcoin (and others) 401k, etf, stocks and bonds… I have separate accounts for 401k and other long term stocks. Then I have multiple exchanges, wallets for short term goals and long term goals (earning interest). I’m fairly new on the crypto side so still learning about DeFi and how and where to use it. Any apps/ sites or information anyone has feel free to share 
hgbx0ol comment Bitcoin is a potential 4X in the next 2 and a half months. That’s POTENTIAL not guaranteed. Dont invest money you’re willing to loose 
hgbxo2e comment both, set up your 401k for auto withdrawal from your check, and get use to that pay and invest what you can into crypto. dont put all your eggs in one basket. 
hgbx01u comment Bruh. Reddit is not financial advice. That being said. Read up on bitcoin. If you understand and truly know its value. DCA in, or lump sum, you do you. But never go all in on one investment.

q6h3el submission When you invest everything in Crypto 
hgc1fm1 comment “Crypto” is risky. Just buy bitcoin 
hgbzete comment Very sensible....just in case BTC moonshots whilst your sleeping. 
hgdnhwr comment We've been saying 'moon' for so long, at what point does it pass that threshold? Wasn't the idea be that the market cap would be equivalent to dollar bills laid end to end reaching the moon or something? What is that actual number? 
hgfevma comment This is a wise choice, , will you all do this? 
hge2pjv comment I think the $2 price point I saw in 2010 to the $65,000 seems like "the moon" to me. Though, as the market cap could potentially reach $10+ trillion as countries adopt it as national currency, I could definitely see another 10x increase in the next 7-8 years. My prediction: it will be almost a decade before we see $500,000 per BTC.

q6hf5h submission While all other crypto 'projects' were trying to hoodwink you, putting crypto lipstick on their centralized corporate pigs, the Bitcoin community was just quietly getting on with rigorously testing the Lightning Network. 
hgch2pd comment And now when the world is not paying attention, the bitcoin developers (at no extra money) are working on drivechain (BIP-300) that literally covers all the "innovation" of top 5 alt-coins in it. If these "smart alt-coin founders" understood bitcoin, they would know that bitcoin can do everything they're trying to do on their own blockchain, but avoided doing it on Bitcoin blockchain, because they just wanted their rich friend investors to be more rich whilst duping people who didn't understand Bitcoin. 
hgc9oj4 comment Buterin vitalik and all of the sick bastards like him are going to go down in history as the exploiters who confused retail buyers and destroyed the one key early investment opportunity the regular man has had in a century. 
hgc4scx comment There is only one corn 
hgc9bg3 comment Sure... But then I wonder... When is Coinbase going to implement lightning? Have any other major US exchanges implemented it or announced they will soon? 

Coinbase doesn't even seem to have Segwit let alone Bech32 addresses.  

Is the market at large keeping up?

Genuinely curious. I'm not close enough to the pulse to know. 
hgcr2c5 comment Without meaning to be adversarial, isn't lightning a, "centralised corporate pig" in the way that the nodes and operated and controlled? Last I read like 80%+ of the funds and routes used were controlled by less than 10% of the network. Have they done anything to deal with the increasing centralisation? 
hgftvm6 comment they just wanted their rich friend investors to be more rich whilst duping people who didn't understand Bitcoin. 
hgg57sv comment Is BIP-300 approved? 
hgcibhu comment Vitalik was a kid when he got in bitcoin. He probably understood how blockchains worked before how manipulative people worked. The kid was manipulated by a rich canadian investor (and probably the rich investor friends too) to work on the bitcoin killer because the canadian investor couldn't get in bitcoin early. It is a sad world!

He probably doesn't even know that he was manipulated. 
hgdj3xe comment Coinbase and indeed most exchanges are strongly disincented from implementing Lightning since Lightning is the final nail in shitcoins' coffins, and exchanges make most of their profits from fees on trades between shitcoins.

hgdwsi9 comment Max is the reason I’m in Bitcoin. I remember seeing this live, it was one of many many segments on his show. I’m eternally  grateful for Max. I think he bothers a lot of youngsters — he’s got an abrasive 90’s vibe. I’m 50 so it clicks. Honestly don’t get the hate Max gets but like I said, it’s probably generational.
